If your mattress is in good condition and could be used by someone else you may want to consider donating it so someone can get more use out of it. St. Vincent De Paul is a great option for mattress donations and is one of the only donation centers in the Orlando area that accepts mattresses.

They also accept bedding and bed frames as well. We recommend contacting them before dropping off to ensure they will accept your mattress.

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Orlando's Craigslist](https://orlando.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

If your mattress is in decent shape there is a very good chance someone will take it off your hands for free or even pay you for it. There is a large market of people looking to save money on a lightly used mattress rather than spend hundreds to thousands on a new one.

If you do list your mattress online make sure to take nice clean photos and ensure potential buyers that it does not have any stains or bed bugs. And always be smart and safe when selling online and meet in a public setting or have someone else around during the sale.

Happy selling!

Looking to take on a small project? Why not recycle your mattress yourself. This is a great way to save some money and do good for the environment. We have a guide on how to do it [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

To start you will want to tear off the cover and separate the foam and metal materials inside.

The metal can be dropped at a local scrap metal yard where they will likely even give you a smalla mount of cash for it. Here it will be melted down and recycled. Local scrap metal yard: http://www.orlandoscrapmetal.com/

The foam can be brought to a local carpet manufacturer or other business (search craigslist for anyone who needs foam). Carpet manufacturers will use it to make carpet padding. Call around before heading anywhere to make sure they will accept used foam form the public. There are lots of businesses from dog bed manufacturers to bean bag chair makers, pillows, etc.... that happily accept foam scraps.
