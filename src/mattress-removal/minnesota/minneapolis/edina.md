  heroDescription: "Professional mattress removal throughout Edina, Minnesota's well-established Twin Cities suburb. From Sunnyslope neighborhoods to Country Club District homes, we provide reliable next-day service for busy residents who value convenience and quality service."
  aboutService: "A Bedder World provides expert mattress removal and recycling services throughout Edina, Minnesota's established Twin Cities suburb. Our professional team handles pickup, transportation, and eco-friendly disposal for over 53,000 residents across diverse neighborhoods, from Sunnyslope's tree-lined streets to historic Country Club District properties. We specialize in mattress recycling - breaking down your old mattress into reusable materials: steel springs, foam padding, cotton fiber, and wood components that support Minnesota's circular economy. Our Edina operation addresses the suburb's specific logistics challenges. We navigate large wooded lots and winding streets throughout established neighborhoods. We coordinate with private waste management since Edina requires residents to contract with licensed haulers rather than providing city collection. We schedule around busy professional lifestyles and family commitments. We handle home renovation timelines and furniture delivery coordination. We manage access through private driveways and secured parking areas as needed. Every mattress we collect is transported to certified recycling facilities where over 90% of materials are recovered. This supports Hennepin County's 90% waste diversion goal and Edina's commitment to environmental responsibility. From historic Morningside homes to modern Interlachen developments, we provide reliable, professional mattress removal services designed for suburban living."
  serviceAreasIntro: "Complete mattress pickup throughout Edina and adjacent Minneapolis suburbs, serving this established community across all neighborhoods from Sunnyslope to Centennial Lakes area:"
  regulationsCompliance: "Unlike many cities, Edina requires residents to contract with licensed private haulers rather than providing city waste collection. Mattress disposal through regular haulers is prohibited and requires special bulky waste arrangements. We eliminate the hassle of coordinating with multiple service providers, negotiating special pickup fees, and managing disposal logistics. Our service provides seamless mattress removal without disrupting your existing waste management arrangements or requiring advance scheduling with haulers."
  environmentalImpact: "Every Edina mattress removal supports Hennepin County's ambitious 90% waste diversion goal and the city's plan to reduce garbage from 54,000 tons to 51,000 tons by 2030. Through partnerships with regional facilities and Hennepin County Environmental Services, we've helped divert hundreds of mattresses from area landfills. Our recycling process aligns with Edina's environmental leadership and educated community values. Steel springs return to regional manufacturing. Foam becomes carpet padding and insulation. Cotton fiber supports textile applications. This closed-loop approach complements the city's organics program and Republic Services recycling initiatives. We help environmentally conscious Edina residents make responsible disposal choices that support their community's sustainability goals and Minnesota's broader circular economy initiatives."
  howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day appointments available throughout Edina. We coordinate around professional schedules, home renovations, and family commitments with flexible timing for busy lifestyles."

localRegulations: "Edina requires residents to contract with licensed private haulers for all waste disposal rather than providing city collection services. Mattresses cannot be disposed of through regular garbage pickup and require special bulky waste arrangements with approved haulers.

Super easy process and the guys were really nice about working around my home office calls. Will definitely use again."

Found A Bedder World through a neighbor's recommendation. What a relief! They handled everything independently, no coordination needed with existing services. Professional team, fair pricing, and they actually showed up when promised. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best ones."

These folks made it painless - quick scheduling, handled stairs like pros, even helped move a dresser out of the way so they could get through. Appreciate the straightforward service during what was already an emotional time for our family."

  },
  {
    "question": "How do you handle Edina's private waste management requirements?",
    "answer": "Unlike cities with municipal collection, Edina requires residents to contract with private haulers, and mattresses aren't accepted through regular garbage pickup. We eliminate the hassle of coordinating special bulky waste arrangements, negotiating additional fees with your existing hauler, and managing disposal logistics. Our service operates independently of your waste management contracts while ensuring proper Hennepin County recycling compliance."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does my Edina mattress go after pickup?",
    "answer": "Your mattress is transported to certified Minnesota recycling facilities working with Hennepin County Environmental Services programs. Materials stay regional when possible - steel springs return to local manufacturing, foam becomes carpet padding, cotton becomes insulation material. Over 90% material recovery rate supports Hennepin County's waste diversion goals and Edina's commitment to reducing community garbage from 54,000 tons to 51,000 tons by 2030."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you serve all Edina neighborhoods and housing types?",
    "answer": "Yes, complete coverage throughout Edina including luxury estates in Sunnyslope and Highlands, historic homes in Morningside and Country Club District, modern developments in Interlachen and Cahill Village, and upscale townhomes and condos throughout the city. We handle everything from million-dollar properties with complex access to luxury senior communities with elevator coordination. Same premium service standards apply citywide."
  },
  {
    "question": "What about bed frames and other bedroom furniture removal?",
    "answer": "Box springs are $30 per piece when removed with mattresses. Metal bed frames typically included at no charge if disassembled. Wooden headboards, bedroom sets, and larger furniture pieces require separate quotes based on size and access complexity. We handle everything from traditional bedroom suites in established Edina neighborhoods to contemporary furniture in modern developments with appropriate care for all items."
