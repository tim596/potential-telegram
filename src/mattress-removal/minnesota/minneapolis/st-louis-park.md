faqs:
  - question: "Do you service all St. Louis Park neighborhoods and districts?"
    answer: "Yes, we provide mattress removal throughout all St. Louis Park areas from the historic Park Spanish Court district to Knollwood area, Miracle Mile, and West End. We're familiar with the city's compact layout and diverse housing types."
    
  - question: "Can you handle pickup from St. Louis Park's historic homes?"
    answer: "Absolutely. St. Louis Park has historic neighborhoods like Park Spanish Court with unique architecture. Our team specializes in protecting original features like hardwood floors and navigating narrow doorways in older homes."
    
  - question: "How does your service work with Hennepin County disposal requirements?"
    answer: "While St. Louis Park residents can use the county transfer station in Brooklyn Park for $25 per mattress, our service provides door-to-door convenience, flexible scheduling, and handles all transportation to certified recycling facilities."
    
  - question: "What's included in your St. Louis Park mattress removal service?"
    answer: "Complete removal from any location (single-family homes, apartments, townhomes, senior housing), loading, transport to certified recycling facilities, and cleanup. We handle Hennepin County disposal requirements and provide documentation for lease compliance."
    
  - question: "Do you work with St. Louis Park's property management companies?"
    answer: "Yes, we regularly service apartment complexes and senior housing throughout St. Louis Park. We provide required disposal documentation and coordinate timing with building management for seamless service."
    
  - question: "Can you remove mattresses from commercial district properties?"
    answer: "Our service covers all properties throughout St. Louis Park including apartments and businesses in the Knollwood area, Miracle Mile district, and West End commercial zones. We handle building access coordination."
    
  - question: "How do I schedule pickup in inner-ring Minneapolis suburbs?"
    answer: "Book online or call 720-263-6094. Next-day service available throughout St. Louis Park with same-day often possible. We maintain expanded capacity specifically for the inner-ring metropolitan area."
    
  - question: "Are you licensed for mattress disposal in Hennepin County?"
    answer: "Yes, we maintain all required Minnesota and Hennepin County licenses for waste hauling and mattress disposal. We work with approved recycling facilities and provide documentation that satisfies city and county requirements."

localRegulations: "Hennepin County requires St. Louis Park residents to dispose of mattresses through the Brooklyn Park Transfer Station, operating Tuesday through Saturday from 9 AM to 5 PM with disposal fees of $25 per mattress piece, requiring residents to transport items to the facility themselves with proof of residency and strict restrictions on certain mattress types. While we also offer convenient curbside removal, our professional service provides superior flexibility with same-day and next-day availability, door-to-door pickup from any location within your property, and elimination of the need to drive across the metro to the transfer station. We maintain all required Hennepin County waste hauler licenses and work directly with certified recycling facilities, providing disposal documentation that satisfies both residential lease requirements and property management standards. Unlike the county transfer station which operates on limited hours and requires self-transport, our service accommodates the busy lifestyles of St. Louis Park residents throughout this established inner-ring suburb with its mix of historic homes, apartment complexes, and commercial districts."

We provide next-day pickup throughout this compact 10.75-square-mile community just 6 miles from downtown Minneapolis, handling everything from single mattress removals in 1960s-era homes to multi-piece pickups from modern apartment complexes near the upcoming Green Line Extension stations. Our team specializes in St. Louis Park's distinct needs - we protect original hardwood floors in Park Spanish Court Historic District homes, coordinate with apartment building managers who handle the city's 41.88% rental market, and work around the narrow doorways common in this established community where the median home was built in 1965. Whether you're near the Pavek Museum of Broadcasting, in the Miracle Mile district, upgrading before the 2027 light rail arrives, or anywhere across St. Louis Park's 35 distinct neighborhoods, we deliver efficient mattress removal with weather protection to prevent the water damage that makes mattresses unrecyclable under Hennepin County rules."
