      text: "Tech professional here, needed convenient scheduling around my Denver commute. Booked online Sunday night for Tuesday pickup - seamless process. Team was efficient and courteous, grabbed everything from our basement bedroom setup. Love that the materials get recycled rather than landfilled. Premium service worth every dollar."

# FAQs
faqs:
  - question: "How quickly can you schedule mattress pickup in Superior?"
    answer: "We provide next-day pickup service throughout Superior's neighborhoods. Most appointments are available within 24-48 hours of booking. During peak moving seasons (spring/summer) or periods with US-36 construction delays, we recommend scheduling 2-3 days in advance for optimal availability."
    
  - question: "What's the exact cost for mattress removal in Superior?"
    answer: "Our pricing is $125 for one piece, $155 for two pieces, $180 for three pieces. This includes pickup from inside your home (including multi-story Rock Creek Ranch properties), professional wrapping, transport, and complete recycling at our Colorado facility. No fuel surcharges or hidden fees - final cost matches your online quote."
    
  - question: "Do you coordinate with Rock Creek Ranch HOA requirements?"
    answer: "Yes, we're familiar with Rock Creek Ranch master-planned community protocols. Our crews work within HOA guidelines for service vehicles and scheduling. We can coordinate timing around community events and understand the higher service standards expected in Superior's premium residential areas."
    
  - question: "Can you handle multi-story homes and basement access?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Superior's housing includes many multi-level homes with basement bedrooms and complex layouts. Our teams regularly navigate stairs, protect walls and railings, and handle challenging access situations. We bring proper equipment for safe removal from any level without additional charges."
    
  - question: "How do you compare to Boulder County's transfer station options?"
    answer: "Nederland Transfer Station offers free mattress recycling but requires proof of Boulder County residency and self-transport during limited hours.

    answer: "Yes, we understand the unique circumstances facing Superior families rebuilding after the Marshall Fire. Our teams are trained to work sensitively around ongoing construction, coordinate with contractors, and accommodate the special scheduling needs of families in temporary housing or reconstruction phases."
    
  - question: "What preparation is needed for pickup?"
    answer: "Simply ensure clear access from your mattress location to the nearest exit. We handle all protective wrapping, lifting, and transport. Unlike transfer station disposal, you don't need to load items yourself or transport to collection sites. Our professional crews protect your home's surfaces during removal."
    
  - question: "Are you licensed for waste collection in Boulder County?"
    answer: "Yes, we maintain all required Boulder County waste hauling licenses and comply with regional service requirements updated in 2025. Our operations meet environmental standards and support Superior's zero waste municipal goals through guaranteed recycling of all collected materials."
