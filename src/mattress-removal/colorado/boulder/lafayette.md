  heroSubtitle: " • Boulder Suburb Specialists • Historic Mining Town to Modern Communities"
  heroDescription: "A Bedder World provides comprehensive mattress removal throughout Lafayette, Colorado. From historic Old Town properties to modern developments like Indian Peaks and Waneka Lake communities, we handle pickup, loading, and transport to our in-house recycling facility. Book online for next-day service."
  
  aboutService: "Lafayette's unique blend of historic coal mining heritage and modern suburban development creates diverse mattress removal needs across varied housing types. Historic Old Town areas require careful navigation of narrow streets and period properties during community festivals and farmers markets. Modern golf course communities like Indian Peaks need coordination with tournament schedules and homeowner association protocols. Newer developments such as Trails at Coal Creek feature construction-era logistics and HOA access requirements. Lafayette residents value our comprehensive recycling process that aligns with the city's environmental consciousness and Boulder County's sustainability leadership while providing convenient pickup throughout all neighborhoods."
  
  serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress pickup throughout Lafayette's distinct communities, from historic Old Town to lakeside Waneka Lake properties and golf course developments at Indian Peaks. We understand each area's unique character and coordinate with HOA requirements, community events, and family schedules."
  
  environmentalImpact: "Lafayette's environmental consciousness as part of Boulder County demands responsible disposal practices, and our in-house recycling facility delivers exactly that. Every Lafayette mattress gets completely dismantled at our Denver facility where metal springs become new steel products, foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabric gets processed into insulation materials. This comprehensive approach exceeds local disposal options including Republic Services bulk pickup limitations and eliminates fees associated with traditional landfill disposal. Our service supports Lafayette's community values while providing convenient year-round pickup that complements the city's annual 5-item bulk cleanup program with unlimited capacity and proper environmental processing."
  
  pricingContext: "Lafayette's diverse housing market - from historic Old Town properties to upscale Indian Peaks golf course homes and family developments along Coal Creek - means varied pickup scenarios, but our pricing remains transparent and fair. Whether removing mattresses from lakeside custom homes or newer community developments, base rates stay consistent. We factor in Lafayette's environmental values by including proper recycling in every price, never charging extra fees like traditional disposal services."
  
  howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day pickup available throughout Lafayette with flexible scheduling around community events, HOA requirements, and Coal Creek Trail activities. We coordinate timing to avoid downtown festivals, golf tournament days, and work with neighborhood access protocols."
  
  howItWorksService: "Our Lafayette team understands the city's unique character - from navigating Old Town's historic district during community events to coordinating with golf course communities and respecting newer development HOA guidelines throughout neighborhoods like Trails at Coal Creek and Blue Heron Estates."
