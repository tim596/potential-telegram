  aboutService: "Fort Collins' unique blend of university culture, craft brewing heritage, and environmental leadership creates specific mattress removal needs across diverse housing types. CSU campus areas require coordination with student schedules and shared housing logistics during semester transitions. Old Town's historic Victorian homes feature narrow staircases and period doorways requiring careful navigation.

We understand each area's unique requirements and coordinate with university schedules, brewery district events, and family routines."
  
  environmentalImpact: "Fort Collins leads Colorado with aggressive zero waste goals - 90% diversion by 2025, 100% by 2030 - and our in-house recycling facility directly supports these initiatives. Every Fort Collins mattress gets completely dismantled at our Denver facility where metal springs become new steel products, foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabric gets processed into insulation materials. This comprehensive approach exceeds local disposal options and eliminates the fees charged at Larimer County Landfill. Unlike the Pay-As-You-Throw system that charges by volume, our service includes environmental responsibility in every pickup while maintaining Fort Collins' sustainability leadership in the Front Range region."

Whether removing mattresses from shared student housing or family bedroom updates, base rates stay consistent. We factor in Fort Collins' environmental consciousness by including proper recycling in every price, never charging extra fees like local disposal facilities."
