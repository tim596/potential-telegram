localRegulations: "Denver requires mattresses to be handled as large items and cannot be placed in regular dumpsters. The city provides large item pickup every 9 weeks for up to 5 items per household at no additional charge, but scheduling is inflexible. Private services like ours offer next-day pickup and handle all disposal compliance. We provide documentation for corporate housing managers and property management companies requiring environmental compliance records."
