  heroSubtitle: " • University Town Specialists • Flatirons to Pearl Street"
  heroDescription: "A Bedder World provides eco-conscious mattress removal throughout Boulder, Colorado. From University Hill student housing to Chautauqua historic homes, we handle pickup, loading, and transport to our in-house recycling facility. Book online for next-day service."
  
  aboutService: "Boulder's unique combination of university housing, historic properties, and environmental consciousness requires specialized mattress removal approaches. University Hill student residences need coordination with move-out schedules and shared living situations. Historic neighborhoods like Mapleton Hill and Chautauqua feature Victorian homes with narrow staircases and architectural details requiring careful navigation. Boulder's environmentally-aware residents value our comprehensive recycling process that diverts 100% of materials from landfills, aligning with the city's sustainability leadership and zero-waste initiatives."
  
  serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress pickup throughout Boulder's diverse neighborhoods, from university housing near campus to foothills communities like Chautauqua. We understand Boulder's unique mix of student rentals, historic properties, and modern developments."
  
  environmentalImpact: "Boulder residents expect environmental responsibility, and our in-house recycling facility delivers exactly that. Every Boulder mattress gets completely dismantled at our Denver facility - metal springs become new steel products, foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabric gets processed into insulation materials. This comprehensive approach supports Boulder's climate goals and zero-waste initiatives while complementing existing programs like Eco-Cycle CHaRM. Unlike drop-off recycling that requires residents to transport heavy mattresses, our service provides convenient pickup while maintaining the same environmental standards Boulder values."
  
  pricingContext: "Boulder's diverse housing market - from student apartments to historic Victorian homes - means varied pickup scenarios, but our pricing remains transparent and fair. Whether removing mattresses from University Hill shared housing or Table Mesa family homes, base rates stay consistent. We factor in Boulder's commitment to sustainability by including environmental disposal in every price, never charging extra for proper recycling."
  
  howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day pickup available throughout Boulder with flexible scheduling for student move-outs, family transitions, and renovation projects. We coordinate timing around university schedules, traffic patterns on 28th Street and Broadway, and neighborhood parking restrictions."
  
  howItWorksService: "Our Boulder team understands the city's unique character - from navigating narrow streets in historic neighborhoods to coordinating with property managers near campus. We handle everything from shared student housing logistics to careful removal from heritage homes with original architectural features."
  
  howItWorksDisposal: "All Boulder mattresses are transported to our Colorado in-house recycling facility for complete material recovery. This supports both local recycling economy and Boulder's environmental leadership in the Front Range region."
