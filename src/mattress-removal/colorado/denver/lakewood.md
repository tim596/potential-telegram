faqs:
  - question: "How do you handle basement stairs and split-level home access in Lakewood?"
    answer: "Many Lakewood homes feature challenging layouts with basement stairs and multi-level designs. Our team comes equipped with proper dollies and protective equipment for tight spaces. We assess stairway dimensions and navigate split-level access safely, protecting walls and floors during removal."
  - question: "What are Lakewood's parking restrictions for service vehicles?"
    answer: "Colorado law requires 2+ feet clearance on narrow roads, 5 feet from driveways, and 15 feet from fire hydrants. We coordinate advance timing to ensure compliant parking and avoid morning eastbound 6th Avenue traffic. Our team follows all Jefferson County access regulations."
  - question: "Do you avoid rush hour traffic when scheduling Lakewood pickups?"
    answer: "Yes, we plan around Lakewood's traffic patterns including morning eastbound congestion on 6th Avenue and weekend I-70 delays. Service windows are scheduled to minimize travel time and ensure prompt arrival. Flexible timing accommodates your schedule and local traffic conditions."
  - question: "Can you handle mattress removal from Belmar apartments and condos?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We coordinate with building management for elevator access and loading dock usage. Our team works within building guidelines and peak hour restrictions. All high-rise and multi-story removals include proper scheduling and resident consideration."
  - question: "What disposal options are available since Lakewood doesn't offer municipal pickup?"
    answer: "We transport mattresses directly to our own in-house Colorado mattress recycling facility where materials are fully processed and broken down. No third-party disposal fees or delays. All recycling meets Jefferson County requirements through our licensed hauler services. You receive pickup confirmation and recycling documentation."
  - question: "How quickly can you provide service throughout Lakewood neighborhoods?"
    answer: "Next-day service is available across all Lakewood areas from Green Mountain Estates to Belmar. We serve established neighborhoods like Applewood and newer developments equally. Scheduling accommodates your timing needs and local access requirements."
  - question: "Do you charge extra for challenging access in hillside homes?"
    answer: "Our standard pricing includes normal access challenges like basement stairs and split-level layouts. Additional fees only apply for extreme situations over 75 feet carry distance. Most Green Mountain and hillside home removals are included in base pricing."
  - question: "Are you licensed for bulk item removal in Jefferson County?"
    answer: "Yes, we maintain all required Jefferson County licensing for bulk item pickup. We comply with local regulations and work with approved disposal facilities. Our service meets all legal requirements for private hauler operations in Lakewood."
