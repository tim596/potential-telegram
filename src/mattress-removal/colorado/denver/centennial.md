faqs:
  - question: "How much advance notice do you need for Centennial pickups?"
    answer: "We need 24-48 hours notice for most Centennial communities. Gated communities require advance vendor approval and insurance certificate submission. This timing allows us to coordinate with HOA management, obtain gate access codes, and reserve elevators if needed."
  - question: "My address shows as Aurora/Littleton online but I live in Centennial. Will you find me?"
    answer: "This is extremely common in Centennial due to USPS ZIP code mapping. We verify all addresses before service and use GPS coordinates to ensure our team arrives at the correct location. Always provide your actual street address and mention you're in Centennial when booking."
  - question: "What documentation do I need to provide for my HOA?"
    answer: "We provide certificate of insurance, business license, and vendor information sheets as required by your community. Most HOAs need these 24-72 hours before service. We handle all paperwork submission and can work directly with your management company if needed."
  - question: "Can you pick up from inside my home or do I need to move mattresses outside?"
    answer: "Community rules vary on pickup locations. Some allow curbside only, others permit garage or designated areas. We coordinate with your HOA's specific guidelines during booking to ensure proper placement and avoid any community violations."
  - question: "Do you handle elevator reservations and building coordination?"
    answer: "Yes, we coordinate all building access requirements including elevator reservations, loading dock scheduling, and building management approval. Our team works within your building's maintenance schedules and resident guidelines for minimal disruption."
  - question: "What if my mattress has bed bugs or is damaged?"
    answer: "We can handle bed bug infested mattresses with proper exterminator documentation and safety protocols. Wet, frozen, or severely damaged mattresses may require additional preparation or fees. We'll assess your specific situation during booking to provide accurate pricing."
  - question: "Are there any extra charges for gated communities or high-rise buildings?"
    answer: "Our pricing includes all standard coordination and access fees. No additional charges for gate access, elevator usage, or basic HOA documentation. Additional fees only apply for special circumstances like bed bug treatment or excessive carry distance."
  - question: "Can you provide proof of recycling for environmental or HOA requirements?"
    answer: "We provide pickup confirmation and can supply basic disposal documentation showing your mattresses went to approved recycling facilities. While we don't provide detailed recycling certificates, we can confirm responsible disposal methods for community records."

    ## Common Issues & Solutions

    ### Address & Location Problems
    **"GPS shows wrong address"**
    Solution: USPS ZIP codes often default to Aurora, Littleton, or Englewood instead of Centennial. Always specify "Centennial, CO" when booking and provide exact street address. We verify all locations before dispatch.

    **"Service team can't find my location"**
    Solution: Centennial's newer developments may not appear in older GPS systems. We use updated mapping and coordinate directly with customers for any location confusion.

    ### Access & Entry Issues
    **"Gate won't let service team in"**
    Solution: Visitor systems sometimes expire or malfunction. We coordinate backup entry procedures and work with gate attendants to resolve access issues quickly.

    **"HOA says they never approved service"**
    Solution: We maintain documentation of all HOA submissions and approvals. Contact us immediately and we'll work with your management company to resolve any communication gaps.

    ### Service Day Problems
    **"Team arrived but can't access elevator"**
    Solution: Building maintenance or resident activities sometimes conflict with reservations. Our team works with building management to find alternative timing or access methods.

    **"Mattress is too big for doorway/stairway"**
    Solution: Our experienced team can disassemble most mattresses for easier removal. This is included in our service when necessary for safe removal.

    ### Weather & Seasonal Issues
    **"Mattress is frozen to ground/wet from snow"**
    Solution: Colorado winters create unique challenges. We can handle frozen mattresses with additional preparation time, but may need to reschedule if items are completely encased in ice.

    **"Heavy snow blocking access"**
    Solution: We monitor weather conditions and coordinate with customers for safe access. Service can be rescheduled at no charge for severe weather conditions.
