# Local regulations content
localRegulations: "Wheat Ridge participates in Jefferson County's regulated waste system but offers unique resident benefits. The city provides annual large item pickup service (May dates) for first 190 registrants - free mattress removal curbside by 7am placement. No wrapping required, but items must be safely liftable. Residents can also use licensed private haulers year-round or self-haul to Spring Back Colorado (Commerce City) at $40 per piece. Unlike states with mattress stewardship programs, Colorado requires private recycling solutions, making professional pickup services essential for busy families."

      text: "Booked pickup for our master bedroom renovation - they handled a king mattress and box spring from our ranch-style home perfectly. Team called ahead, arrived exactly when promised, and navigated our narrow hallway without scuffing walls. Appreciated that they wrapped everything before removal. Total was $155 as quoted, no surprises."

      text: "Fantastic service for our townhome move-out. Picked up two twin mattresses from upstairs bedrooms - crew was professional and careful going down the stairs. Scheduling was easy online, and they texted updates about arrival. Much easier than trying to haul these myself to a recycling center."

      text: "Replaced our guest room mattress and needed the old one gone quickly. Service was prompt and efficient - team showed up right on time, grabbed everything from inside the house, and had it loaded in minutes. Fair pricing and knowing it gets recycled instead of dumped made this the obvious choice."

# FAQs
faqs:
  - question: "How quickly can you schedule mattress pickup in Wheat Ridge?"
    answer: "We offer next-day pickup service throughout Wheat Ridge neighborhoods. Most appointments are available within 24-48 hours of booking. During peak moving season (summer) or after the city's annual May pickup dates, we recommend scheduling 2-3 days ahead for optimal availability."
    
  - question: "What's the exact cost for mattress removal in Wheat Ridge?"
    answer: "Our standard fee is $125 for one mattress or box spring, with additional pieces at $30 each. A king mattress and box spring costs $155 total. This includes pickup from inside your home, professional wrapping, transport, and complete recycling at our Colorado facility. No fuel surcharges or hidden fees."
    
  - question: "Do you service all Wheat Ridge neighborhoods and ZIP codes?"
    answer: "Yes, we provide comprehensive coverage throughout all Wheat Ridge areas including Olde Town (80033), Clear Creek Terrace and WestRidge (80034), West End developments (80214), and Applewood border areas (80215). Our crews know local access routes and work around current Wadsworth Boulevard construction."
    
  - question: "Can you handle mattress removal from ranch homes and townhouses?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Our teams regularly service Wheat Ridge's mix of ranch-style homes in Fruitdale and Crown Point, plus newer townhouse developments like Clear Creek Terrace. We handle stairs, narrow hallways, and tight corners without wall damage. No additional charge for second-story pickup."
    
  - question: "How does your recycling compare to Wheat Ridge's city pickup program?"
    answer: "The city's annual May program serves 190 homes with free curbside pickup, but items go to landfills. Our service costs $125-155 but guarantees 100% recycling - metal springs become recycled steel, foam transforms into carpet padding, fabric gets reprocessed. Plus we're available year-round with flexible scheduling."
    
  - question: "What preparation is needed for mattress pickup?"
    answer: "Simply clear a path from your mattress location to the exit. We handle all lifting, wrapping, and transport. No need to move furniture or prepare items like the city program requires. Our crew will protect floors and walls during removal."
    
  - question: "Do Wadsworth Boulevard construction delays affect service?"
    answer: "Our drivers stay current on Wadsworth improvement project status and adjust routes accordingly. The ongoing construction may add 10-15 minutes to arrival times in some areas, but we factor this into scheduling and provide real-time text updates about any delays."
    
  - question: "Are you licensed and insured in Jefferson County?"
    answer: "Yes, we maintain all required Colorado and Jefferson County licensing for waste hauling and recycling services. Our teams are fully insured with liability and workers compensation coverage. We comply with all state environmental regulations for mattress material processing."

  heroDescription: "Professional mattress removal serving all Wheat Ridge neighborhoods. From Olde Town ranch homes to Clear Creek Terrace townhomes, we provide next-day pickup and guaranteed recycling through our Colorado facility."
  
  aboutService: "Wheat Ridge families face specific mattress disposal challenges that our local crews understand completely. Ranch-style homes in Fruitdale and Crown Point require careful navigation of narrow hallways and doorways. The ongoing Wadsworth Boulevard reconstruction affects timing throughout central corridors, so we adjust routes and provide realistic arrival windows. Clear Creek Terrace and newer townhouse developments need stair-capable teams for second-story pickup. Unlike the city's limited annual program serving 190 homes, we provide year-round service with guaranteed recycling rather than landfill disposal."
  
  serviceAreasIntro: "Our comprehensive Wheat Ridge coverage spans from historic Olde Town to modern developments, handling the unique access requirements of each neighborhood type."
  
  regulationsCompliance: "We ensure full compliance with Jefferson County waste handling regulations and Colorado's evolving environmental standards. Our licensed hauling permits meet all state requirements, and our recycling facility follows strict material processing protocols established by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment."
  
  environmentalImpact: "Every Wheat Ridge mattress goes directly to our in-house Colorado recycling facility where trained technicians separate components by material type. Metal springs get processed at certified scrap recycling centers, becoming new steel products. Foam padding transforms into high-quality carpet underlay through our manufacturing partnerships. Fabric materials undergo fiber processing for new textile applications. This keeps approximately 40-75 pounds of materials per mattress out of Colorado landfills while supporting the state's waste diversion goals."
  
  howItWorksScheduling: "Book online through our scheduling system or call directly. We confirm appointments with specific time windows that account for current Wadsworth construction delays."
  
  howItWorksService: "Our uniformed crew arrives with proper lifting equipment and protective materials. We handle everything from ranch home bedrooms, townhouse stairs, or garage storage areas."
  
  howItWorksDisposal: "Items get professionally wrapped for transport, loaded into our vehicles, and transported directly to our Colorado recycling facility where materials get immediately processed."
