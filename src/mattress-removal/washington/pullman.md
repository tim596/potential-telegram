localRegulations: "Washington State regulations prohibit mattresses from regular garbage collection, requiring Pullman residents to use specialized disposal methods. The Whitman County Regional Landfill accepts mattresses at limited hours (Monday-Friday, 8am-4:30pm), but college students and faculty face unique barriers: most students don't have vehicles large enough to transport mattresses, semester transitions create high disposal demand that overwhelms facility capacity, academic schedules conflict with facility operating hours, Greek houses and shared apartments generate multiple mattresses simultaneously, graduation timing creates disposal bottlenecks when students leave town quickly, and residence hall policies restrict large item removals without proper coordination. Our professional service eliminates these university-specific challenges completely - no vehicle requirements, no facility hour restrictions, no transportation logistics, and next-day service that works with academic calendars. We coordinate with residence hall staff for smooth pickup, handle bulk removals from shared housing, and provide environmentally responsible recycling that aligns with WSU's sustainability mission."

  aboutService: "Pullman residents enjoy the unique distinction of living in Washington's premier college town, where Washington State University's academic excellence meets Palouse agricultural heritage in a community that educates the nation while maintaining small-town character. Our professional mattress removal service understands this university community's distinctive needs: flexible pickup that works with academic calendars, student move-in/move-out timing, and the practical demands of residents who balance university life with rural community living in neighborhoods throughout the Palouse region. Whether you're a WSU student navigating residence hall transitions or apartment moves, faculty and staff managing sabbaticals and relocations, international students and scholars adapting to American housing systems, families living in established neighborhoods like College Hill or Military Hill, or local residents who chose Pullman for its university atmosphere and outdoor recreation access, we make mattress disposal straightforward with next-day pickup that respects Pullman's role as the intellectual heart of the Palouse. Pullman's position as a college town creates unique service opportunities that eliminate the hassle of coordinating county landfill visits with busy academic schedules, graduation timing, and semester transitions - no disposal fees, no facility hour restrictions, no transportation logistics for students without vehicles, just professional pickup when your course loads, research commitments, and academic calendar allow. Each collected mattress flows through our proven nationwide recycling network, supporting WSU's sustainability mission while serving the community that educates future leaders throughout the Pacific Northwest."
  serviceAreasIntro: "From WSU campus residence halls to off-campus neighborhoods, we provide comprehensive mattress pickup throughout Pullman and the greater Palouse region:"
  environmentalImpact: "<p>Washington State University has strong sustainability commitments, and A Bedder World aligns with these values through responsible mattress recycling. Rather than contributing to regional landfill challenges, we break down mattresses into recyclable components:</p><ul><li><strong>Steel springs</strong> are recycled into new metal products</li><li><strong>Foam</strong> becomes carpet padding or construction materials</li><li><strong>Fabric</strong> is repurposed for industrial uses</li><li><strong>Wood components</strong> are processed for biomass fuel</li></ul><p>This approach supports both WSU's environmental mission and keeps the beautiful Palouse region cleaner for current and future Cougar generations. Our recycling partners work with university facilities to ensure all disposal meets both state environmental standards and WSU's sustainability goals.</p>"
