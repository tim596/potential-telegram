  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Bothell's environmentally conscious community and sustainability-focused institutions benefit from advanced mattress recycling practices that align with the city's annual Sustainamania festival values. The dual-county system allows access to both King County and Snohomish County recycling facilities, where specialized mattress disassembly recovers steel springs, memory foam components, and textiles for industrial reuse applications.</p>

    <p>Working directly with approved facilities in both counties, we ensure 85% of mattress materials avoid landfill disposal through established recycling networks. Our process supports UW Bothell's campus sustainability initiatives and complements local environmental programs like the 64-acre North Creek Forest restoration and the city's 400-acre park system preservation efforts.</p>

    <p>For university students, biotech professionals, and families committed to environmental stewardship, our service provides measurable waste diversion that supports Bothell's sustainability goals. Each mattress processed represents approximately 65 pounds of material recovered through county-approved recycling channels rather than contributing to regional waste capacity concerns.</p>
