localRegulations: "Washington State regulations prohibit mattresses from regular garbage collection, requiring Spokane residents to use specialized disposal methods. The Spokane Regional Solid Waste System accepts mattresses at their North County transfer station during limited hours (Tuesday-Saturday, 7:30am-4:30pm), but residents must transport mattresses themselves and pay disposal fees. Spokane's healthcare workforce and university community face unique challenges: medical professionals working rotating shifts at Sacred Heart and MultiCare hospitals can't reach facilities during operating hours, Gonzaga University students lack transportation for mattress disposal, families managing work and activities struggle with facility access restrictions, and professionals prefer environmentally responsible disposal that reflects Spokane's outdoor recreation culture. Our professional service eliminates these barriers completely - no transportation required, no facility hour restrictions, no disposal fees, and environmentally responsible recycling that matches Spokane's commitment to natural resource stewardship. We handle all regulatory compliance, provide next-day pickup, and ensure proper recycling through our licensed network, making mattress disposal effortless for Spokane's medical professionals, university families, and outdoor enthusiasts."
