    - text: "These folks were absolutely fantastic! Working at UofL Hospital means crazy shifts, and they scheduled around my 12-hour rotations perfectly. Had two old mattresses from when my daughter moved back home after college. Fair pricing, professional crew, and they even knew to avoid the narrow streets during Thunder Over Louisville prep. Definitely recommend to any healthcare workers dealing with unpredictable schedules."
