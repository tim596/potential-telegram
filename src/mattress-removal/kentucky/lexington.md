    - text: "Moving kids into dorms at UK and needed the guest room mattresses cleared out fast. Found these folks online Sunday night, scheduled Monday morning, picked up Tuesday before we left for campus move-in. Super easy process and they were really professional about working around our crazy schedule. The fact that they recycle everything instead of just dumping it somewhere really matters to our family - we try to be conscious about waste and this felt like the right choice. Would definitely recommend to other UK families dealing with housing transitions."
