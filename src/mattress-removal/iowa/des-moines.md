localRegulations: "Des Moines requires $5 pink Large Item Stickers for mattress disposal through city pickup, plus 24-hour advance scheduling and specific curbside placement rules. Metro Waste Authority operates county facilities charging $20+ per mattress. Why deal with sticker purchases, scheduling delays, and weather-dependent curbside placement when you need immediate removal? Our next-day professional service eliminates sticker requirements, handles indoor pickup from any floor, and provides guaranteed 100% recycling. Perfect for Iowa's insurance capital where busy professionals value efficiency and reliability."

    - text: "We've lived in Highland Park for 15 years and this was hands-down the easiest furniture removal we've ever done. The guys were super careful with our hardwood floors and tight hallways. My husband was impressed they actually recycle everything instead of just dumping it somewhere."

faqs:
  - question: "How does pickup work around Des Moines' corporate schedule demands?"
    answer: "We understand insurance industry timing - quarterly closings, client meetings, conference calls. Next-day scheduling works around downtown business hours and suburban professional schedules without city sticker delays."
  - question: "Do you serve all Des Moines neighborhoods and surrounding areas?"
    answer: "Absolutely. From East Village downtown to Beaverdale neighborhoods, Highland Park to Greater South Side - we serve the entire Des Moines metro throughout Polk County."
  - question: "Can you coordinate with corporate housing and apartment complex policies?"
    answer: "Yes. Des Moines has significant corporate relocations and apartment living. We handle building access requirements, management company coordination, and tight moving schedules common in the insurance capital."
  - question: "What's included beyond basic removal?"
    answer: "Complete service includes pickup from any floor, professional transportation, and 100% mattress recycling. No sticker purchases, advance scheduling, or curbside placement requirements."
  - question: "How does recycling work compared to Metro Waste Authority disposal?"
    answer: "MWA facilities typically landfill mattresses despite recycling capabilities. We guarantee 100% recycling - steel springs become manufacturing materials, foam transforms into carpet padding, fabric converts to insulation."
  - question: "Do you handle Des Moines' flat terrain and grid system efficiently?"
    answer: "Our service routes maximize Des Moines' efficient grid layout and level prairie terrain. Interstate access via I-35, I-80, and I-235 enables quick metro area coverage from downtown to suburbs."
  - question: "Can you work with older Des Moines housing and narrow spaces?"
    answer: "Experienced with Des Moines housing variety - historic Sherman Hill homes, established Highland Park properties, newer Somerset developments. We navigate different architectural challenges professionally."
  - question: "How does your service compare to city Large Item Sticker program?"
    answer: "Immediate next-day availability versus 24+ hour city scheduling, professional indoor removal versus curbside requirements, and guaranteed recycling rather than landfill disposal at county facilities."
