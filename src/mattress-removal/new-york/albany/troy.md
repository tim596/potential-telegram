We handle all scheduling requirements and work within Troy's specific disposal protocols.

  environmentalImpact: "Our Troy mattress recycling service contributes to our nationwide achievement of responsibly recycling over 1 million mattresses, with each Troy pickup directly supporting the Capital District's environmental sustainability initiatives. Every mattress we collect diverts approximately 40 pounds of mixed materials from Rensselaer County's waste system, including steel springs (15 lbs), polyurethane foam (12 lbs), cotton and fabric components (8 lbs), and wood elements (5 lbs). Our regional recycling partnerships with certified Capital Region facilities ensure materials processing supports local manufacturing while reducing transportation emissions through nearby processing networks. Steel springs from Troy mattresses are processed at facilities serving the Greater Albany area, while foam materials are converted to insulation and carpet padding used in Capital District construction and historic building renovation projects - directly supporting the region's infrastructure development including ongoing RPI campus improvements and Troy's downtown revitalization initiatives. This regional processing approach reduces truck traffic through Troy's historic neighborhoods by 65% compared to out-of-state disposal, protecting the Collar City's character while contributing to New York State's circular economy goals. Our partnerships have helped divert over 1,156 Troy-area mattresses from landfills in the past 16 months, preventing approximately 46,240 pounds of materials from entering waste streams while supporting the region's sustainable development objectives."
