Part of our nationwide 1M+ mattresses recycled achievement."

  aboutService: "Our professional mattress removal service brings specialized expertise to Syracuse's unique needs as Central New York's educational and economic hub. Having responsibly recycled over 1 million mattresses nationwide, we understand the demanding pace of university housing cycles, the architectural challenges of pre-1940 historic neighborhoods, and the year-round logistics of harsh Central New York winters. Our comprehensive mattress disposal service coordinates seamlessly around Syracuse University's academic calendar, SUNY Upstate Medical schedules, and the professional obligations of healthcare and education workers throughout the region.

Our licensed removal team uses specialized equipment designed for Syracuse's challenging terrain, from downtown's flat areas to the elevated southern neighborhoods reaching 1,500 feet, bringing protective winter gear and narrow-stair navigation tools for the city's 44.5% pre-1940 housing stock. Beyond standard removal, we handle complete sleep system disassembly, box spring separation, and Syracuse municipal compliance while accommodating university move-out deadlines and the region's 100+ inch annual snowfall patterns. Every Syracuse service includes proper documentation for apartment complex management and coordination with the seasonal housing turnover that defines Central New York's largest city."

  serviceAreasIntro: "Expert mattress pickup throughout Syracuse's established neighborhoods, from University Hill student areas to historic Tipperary Hill:"

  regulationsCompliance: "Our Syracuse service ensures complete municipal compliance including proper coordination with city bulk pickup services (315-448-CITY) and OCRRA facility requirements. We handle all scheduling notifications and provide alternatives to the $20 county facility fees. Our licensed waste transporter credentials maintain full regulatory compliance while offering convenient private service."

  environmentalImpact: "Our Syracuse mattress recycling service contributes to our nationwide achievement of responsibly recycling over 1 million mattresses, with each Syracuse pickup directly supporting Central New York's environmental sustainability initiatives. Every mattress we collect diverts approximately 40 pounds of mixed materials from Onondaga County's waste system, including steel springs (15 lbs), polyurethane foam (12 lbs), cotton and fabric components (8 lbs), and wood elements (5 lbs). Our regional recycling partnerships with certified Central New York facilities ensure materials processing supports local manufacturing while reducing transportation emissions through regional processing networks. Steel springs from Syracuse mattresses are processed at facilities serving the Greater Central New York region, while foam materials are converted to insulation and carpet padding used in Syracuse area construction and historic building renovation projects including the ongoing University Hill development and Micron facility construction. This regional processing approach reduces truck traffic through Syracuse's residential neighborhoods by 60% compared to out-of-state disposal, protecting the community's character while contributing to New York State's waste reduction goals. Our partnerships have helped divert over 1,892 Syracuse-area mattresses from landfills in the past 20 months, preventing approximately 75,680 pounds of materials from entering waste streams while supporting the region's circular economy initiatives."
