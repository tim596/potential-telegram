localRegulations: "South Bend residents receive weekly trash collection with one free monthly bulky item pickup through the city's 311 system. St. Joseph County regulations prohibit open dumping and require disposal at permitted facilities. Without Indiana's Bye Bye Mattress program, residents depend on city bulk service that often sends mattresses to landfills. Why settle for monthly scheduling limits when you need immediate pickup? Our next-day professional service eliminates waiting periods, provides guaranteed 100% recycling instead of landfill disposal, and includes full-service indoor removal. Perfect for Notre Dame's academic community that values environmental responsibility and flexible scheduling."

faqs:
  - question: "How does pickup work around Notre Dame's academic calendar?"
    answer: "We understand university timing - student move-outs, faculty transitions, semester breaks. Next-day scheduling accommodates tight academic deadlines without waiting for city's monthly bulk pickup limits."
  - question: "Do you serve all South Bend neighborhoods and St. Joseph County?"
    answer: "Absolutely. From Notre Dame area and River Park to downtown and every neighborhood along the St. Joseph River, we serve the entire South Bend metro throughout St. Joseph County."
  - question: "Can you coordinate with university housing timelines?"
    answer: "Yes. Graduate housing transitions, faculty relocations, semester-end deadlines - we sync with academic schedules that don't match standard city bulk pickup availability."
  - question: "What's included beyond basic removal?"
    answer: "Full-service pickup from any floor, transportation, and 100% mattress recycling. No city-style monthly limits or preparation requirements."
  - question: "How does recycling work compared to county disposal requirements?"
    answer: "St. Joseph County requires permitted facility disposal, but most facilities landfill mattresses. We guarantee 100% recycling - springs become steel products, foam becomes padding, fabric becomes insulation."
  - question: "Do you accommodate Notre Dame event schedules?"
    answer: "Certainly. Home game weekends, graduation ceremonies, major campus events - we schedule around South Bend's unique university-town rhythm and visitor patterns."
  - question: "Can you handle multi-story buildings and campus-area apartments?"
    answer: "Our team navigates university district complexes, historic downtown buildings, and riverfront properties common in South Bend's diverse housing landscape."
  - question: "How does your service compare to city bulk pickup?"
    answer: "Immediate next-day availability vs. monthly limits, professional indoor removal, and guaranteed recycling rather than standard county disposal methods."
