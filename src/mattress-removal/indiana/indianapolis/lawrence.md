faqs:
  - question: "Do you really recycle every mattress you pick up in Lawrence?"
    answer: "Absolutely! We've recycled over 1 million mattresses nationwide with 100% recycling rate over 13+ years. Every Lawrence mattress is processed through certified facilities - springs become construction materials, foam becomes carpet padding, and fabrics enter textile recycling streams."
  - question: "How quickly can you pick up from Lawrence's diverse neighborhoods?"
    answer: "Next-day service is standard throughout Lawrence, from Fort Ben historic areas to Geist lakeside properties and working neighborhoods along Post Road. We navigate efficiently around ongoing Pendleton Pike construction and I-465 projects."
  - question: "Can you handle Lawrence's varied housing from military quarters to lake homes?"
    answer: "Yes, our 13+ years serving Indianapolis means we're experienced with everything from converted officers' quarters in Fort Ben to modern lake homes at Geist and ranch houses throughout Lawrence's residential areas. We adapt to each property's unique access requirements."
  - question: "What's included in Lawrence's $125 starting price?"
    answer: "Complete service including pickup, Marion County-compliant disposal, transportation, and guaranteed 100% recycling. Additional charges apply for stairs ($10/flight) or carries over 75 feet. No landfill waste ever."

  - question: "Are you licensed for Marion County mattress disposal and recycling?"
    answer: "Yes, we're fully licensed Marion County haulers working with approved contractors.
