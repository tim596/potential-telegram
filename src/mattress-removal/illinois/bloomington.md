  aboutService: |
    <p>Bloomington's mix of student housing and established neighborhoods creates unique mattress removal challenges our team handles daily. Student apartments near ISU often have tight staircases and lease change deadlines, while residential areas deal with families upgrading beds and needing immediate pickup. Our experience with college town logistics means efficient service during peak move-out periods when other services get overwhelmed.</p>
    
    <p>The city's bi-annual free bulk pickup system works for some residents, but students and busy families need flexibility. We bridge this gap with year-round availability, working around ISU academic calendars and accommodating urgent removals that can't wait for May or October pickup windows.</p>
    
    <p>Every Bloomington mattress removal contributes to our 1+ million recycled nationwide. Rather than adding to McLean County landfills, your old mattress becomes valuable materials through our certified recycling process, supporting both local and national sustainability efforts.</p>
