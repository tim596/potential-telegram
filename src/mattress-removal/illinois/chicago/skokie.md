  aboutService: |
    <p>Skokie's diverse housing presents specific mattress removal challenges our team navigates daily. From Devonshire's 1950s ranch homes with basement bedrooms to downtown high-rises where elevator scheduling matters, we adapt to each building's requirements. Our experience with Skokie's older apartment complexes means we know which buildings have narrow hallways and which require loading dock coordination.</p>
    
    <p>Dense neighborhoods like Timber Ridge and Kingston Estates mean efficient routing, while the village's excellent transit connections via Yellow Line make us easily accessible for scheduling. We serve everyone from long-term residents in established areas to newer families in apartment complexes throughout both ZIP codes.</p>
    
    <p>Every Skokie mattress removal contributes to our 1+ million recycled nationwide. Instead of adding to landfill waste, your old mattress becomes new construction steel, carpet padding, and textile materials through our certified recycling process.</p>
