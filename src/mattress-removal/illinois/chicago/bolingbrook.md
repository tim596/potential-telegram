    - text: "Our Americana Estates home required careful coordination due to the gated community access protocols. The team handled our California King mattress removal from our second floor perfectly, working around our HOA's delivery windows. Knowing our old mattress joins their 1M+ recycling milestone instead of filling Will County landfills made the $180 worth every penny."

Team navigated our tight driveway and handled our queen set removal during the busy summer tournament weekend. Professional service and the 100% recycling guarantee aligns perfectly with Bolingbrook's environmental initiatives."

    - text: "Needed pickup from our Remington Lakes apartment while coordinating with Flood Brothers' regular bulk schedule. The team worked efficiently around the community's waste management requirements, removed our memory foam mattress, and the next-day service meant we didn't have to wait for the weekly bulk pickup. Great to support a company that's recycled over a million mattresses."

  regulationsCompliance: "Bolingbrook requires bulk items to be scheduled through Flood Brothers with additional fees for extra items - requirements we exceed through our independent pickup process.

    <p>Bolingbrook's 74,088 residents generate significant mattress waste, but our recycling-first approach ensures zero village mattresses reach landfills. As part of our 1+ million mattresses recycled nationwide, every Bolingbrook pickup contributes to environmental protection through comprehensive materials recovery.</p>
    
    <p>We partner with Will County and DuPage County recycling facilities to process Bolingbrook's mattresses into valuable materials - steel springs become new construction materials, memory foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabric components enter textile recycling streams. This circular economy approach supports the village's sustainability goals while reducing environmental impact across both county jurisdictions.</p>
