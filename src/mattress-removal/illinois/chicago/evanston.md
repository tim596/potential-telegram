    - text: "Northwestern student moving out in June after graduation needed our queen mattress removed from a Ridge Avenue apartment near campus. Team navigated the narrow vintage staircase and coordinated pickup around the university's move-out deadline. Having our mattress join the 1M+ recycling milestone instead of waiting months for the city's bulk pickup made the $155 totally worth it during such a hectic week."

    - text: "Downsizing from our lakefront condo on Sheridan Road to a smaller place downtown. The crew handled our California King removal from the 8th floor efficiently, working around building management protocols and weekend elevator restrictions. Great to know our old mattress gets 100% recycled through their proven process rather than contributing to lakefill waste."

      neighborhood: "Lakefront Homes" 
    - text: "Replaced our memory foam set after water damage in our Davis Street high-rise. Team scheduled around Purple Line rush hour traffic and building loading dock requirements. Next-day pickup meant we didn't have to store the damaged mattress or wait for the city's twice-yearly bulk service. Professional removal that fits North Shore expectations."

faqs:
  - question: "Do you coordinate with Northwestern University's academic schedule?"
    answer: "Yes! We understand peak move-out periods, especially the critical June 14th spring quarter deadline when thousands of students need mattress disposal. We plan extra capacity during Northwestern's major transitions and work efficiently around campus area parking and access restrictions."
  - question: "Can you handle high-rise buildings common in downtown Evanston?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We regularly service Davis Street high-rises, lakefront condos, and modern apartment complexes. Our team coordinates with building management, elevator reservations, and loading dock schedules to ensure smooth pickups without disrupting other residents."
  - question: "How do you navigate Evanston's mix of historic homes and vintage apartments?"
    answer: "Our team has extensive experience with Evanston's diverse housing stock - from narrow staircases in 1890s homes near Central Street to tight vintage apartment hallways in the university district. We assess access before pickup and handle everything from lakefront estates to compact student housing units."
  - question: "What makes your service better than waiting for the city's bulk pickup?"
    answer: "Evanston provides bulk pickup twice yearly with a 6 cubic yard limit, but you must wait for your scheduled slot and place items out early. We provide next-day pickup on your timeline, handle all the logistics, and guarantee 100% recycling rather than standard disposal."
  - question: "Do you really recycle every mattress picked up in Evanston?"
    answer: "Absolutely! We've recycled over 1 million mattresses nationwide with 100% recycling rate. Every Evanston mattress goes through certified facilities where springs become construction materials, foam becomes carpet padding, and fabrics enter textile recycling - supporting North Shore environmental values."
  - question: "How quickly can you pick up from the Northwestern campus area?"
    answer: "Next-day service is standard throughout Evanston, including the Northwestern district. We coordinate around Purple Line schedules, campus traffic patterns, and university area parking restrictions to provide efficient pickup during both regular periods and peak move-out times."
  - question: "Can you service both sides of the CTA tracks?"
    answer: "Yes, we provide comprehensive coverage east and west of the Purple Line tracks. Whether you're in the affluent lakefront areas (60201) or the diverse neighborhoods west of the tracks (60202), we handle all Evanston ZIP codes with the same professional service."
  - question: "What's included in your Evanston pricing?"
    answer: "Complete pickup service including professional removal, transportation, and guaranteed 100% recycling. Additional charges apply for stairs ($10/flight) or extended carries beyond 75 feet - common in larger lakefront homes or buildings with restricted loading access."

  heroDescription: "Northwestern University and North Shore mattress recycling with over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide. Serving Evanston's lakefront condos, campus housing, and historic neighborhoods with next-day pickup coordinated around academic schedules and North Shore logistics."
  aboutService: |
    <p>Evanston's 78,110 residents create complex mattress removal challenges that blend university logistics with North Shore sophistication. Northwestern's academic calendar drives predictable disposal surges - especially the critical June 14th spring quarter deadline when thousands of students vacate campus area housing. Meanwhile, lakefront high-rises and vintage apartments throughout the city's 7.8 square miles require different service approaches entirely.</p>
    
    <p>Housing diversity here spans everything from historic homes near Central Street to luxury lakefront condos overlooking Lake Michigan. The university district's narrow vintage apartments contrast sharply with Davis Street's modern high-rises, while Ridge Avenue's established neighborhoods feature architectural gems from the 1880s-1910s era. Each housing type presents unique access challenges our team navigates daily.</p>
    
    <p>Every Evanston pickup contributes to our 1+ million mattresses recycled nationwide, supporting this environmentally conscious community's values. From Purple Line commuters to Northwestern faculty, residents appreciate our commitment to 100% recycling rather than contributing to regional landfill waste, especially given the community's progressive environmental leadership.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "From Northwestern's campus district to lakefront estates along Sheridan Road, our Evanston service covers all neighborhoods across the North Shore's most diverse suburb:"
  regulationsCompliance: "Our licensed service exceeds all Evanston disposal requirements while delivering superior convenience. We eliminate scheduling constraints of seasonal bulk pickup, coordinate professionally with building management protocols, and guarantee 100% recycling through certified facilities - exceeding standard city disposal practices and supporting environmental stewardship values throughout the North Shore community."
  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>With Northwestern University and affluent North Shore residents generating substantial mattress waste, our recycling-first approach ensures zero Evanston mattresses reach landfills. Every pickup adds to our 1+ million mattresses recycled nationwide through comprehensive materials recovery that supports this environmentally progressive community.</p>
    
    <p>We partner with Cook County recycling facilities to transform Evanston's mattresses into valuable materials - steel springs become new construction components, memory foam transforms into carpet padding, and textile components enter recycling streams. This circular approach aligns with Northwestern's sustainability initiatives and the North Shore's environmental stewardship values.</p>
    
    <p>University students, lakefront residents, and longtime families all benefit from our responsible disposal that keeps mattress materials productive rather than occupying Lake Michigan region landfill space, supporting Evanston's leadership in environmental responsibility and sustainable community practices.</p>
  howItWorksScheduling: "Book appointments that work with Evanston's unique rhythm - avoiding Northwestern peak move-out periods when possible, coordinating with Purple Line rush hours, and accommodating lakefront building management schedules and high-rise loading dock reservations."
  howItWorksService: "Our team expertly navigates Evanston's housing diversity - from vintage campus area apartments with narrow hallways to modern lakefront high-rises with elevator protocols, historic Central Street homes with challenging access, and established Ridge Avenue neighborhoods with mature landscaping obstacles."
  howItWorksDisposal: "Every Evanston mattress joins our 1+ million recycling achievement through complete materials separation. Springs, foam, and fabrics process through certified facilities, ensuring your old mattress becomes new products instead of waste - supporting both Northwestern's sustainability goals and North Shore environmental leadership."
