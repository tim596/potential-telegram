  aboutService: |
    <p>With over 13 years serving Des Plaines and 1+ million mattresses recycled nationwide, we're the area's most experienced mattress recycling service. Located just 17 miles northwest of downtown Chicago and near O'Hare Airport, Des Plaines presents unique challenges from downtown high-rise condos to single-family homes along the Des Plaines River Trail.</p>
    
    <p>Our team understands Des Plaines' strategic location and diverse housing landscape - from the entertainment district around Rivers Casino to established neighborhoods near Prairie Lakes and Big Bend Lake. We coordinate around Metra schedules at Cumberland and Des Plaines stations, work efficiently in the busy Elmhurst Road corridor, and handle everything from historic downtown buildings to modern developments.</p>
    
    <p>Every mattress we collect in Des Plaines joins our nationwide recycling achievement of over 1 million mattresses diverted from landfills. Licensed for Cook County operations, we ensure 100% recycling of every pickup while meeting Des Plaines' municipal requirements and supporting the city's environmental commitment.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "From downtown Des Plaines' entertainment district to the peaceful neighborhoods along the Des Plaines River Trail, our service network spans the city's complete 20+ neighborhood footprint:"
  regulationsCompliance: "Our team ensures full compliance with Des Plaines and Cook County waste management ordinances, properly wrapping all mattresses in plastic before transport and utilizing only licensed disposal facilities approved by LRS and regional contractors."
  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Des Plaines' 58,832 residents generate significant mattress waste, but our recycling-first approach ensures zero Des Plaines mattresses reach landfills. As part of our 1+ million mattresses recycled nationwide over 13+ years, every Des Plaines pickup contributes to environmental protection through comprehensive materials recovery.</p>
    
    <p>We partner with Cook County facilities and regional recycling centers to process Des Plaines mattresses into valuable materials - steel springs become new construction materials, memory foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabric components enter textile recycling streams. This circular economy approach supports Des Plaines' sustainability goals while reducing the environmental impact of the city's diverse households.</p>
    
    <p>Des Plaines' business community, from Rivers Casino employees to Oakton Community College staff, all benefit from our environmentally responsible disposal that keeps mattress materials in productive use rather than occupying Cook County landfill space.</p>

  howItWorksService: "Our team navigates Des Plaines' geography with expertise - from downtown high-rise condos with elevator coordination to riverside homes along the Des Plaines River Trail. We handle narrow downtown staircases, suburban townhouse complexes, and single-family homes with equal professionalism."
  howItWorksDisposal: "Every Des Plaines mattress joins our 1+ million recycling milestone through comprehensive materials separation. Springs, foam, and fabrics are processed through certified facilities, ensuring your old mattress becomes new products rather than landfill waste - supporting both Des Plaines' environmental goals and nationwide sustainability efforts."
