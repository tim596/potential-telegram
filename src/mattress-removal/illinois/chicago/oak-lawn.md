    - text: "Historic downtown area pickup was seamless - team understood our 1930s home's narrow hallways perfectly. After finding them through a neighbor's recommendation, we scheduled Saturday morning service. Their 13+ years serving the area really showed when they navigated our limestone foundation basement stairs without any issues."

Called them Thursday, pickup was Friday afternoon around my work schedule. Impressed knowing our mattress joins their 1+ million recycling achievement instead of heading to a Cook County landfill."

Team arrived exactly on time Sunday morning and handled our split-level home's logistics like professionals. Love that they've been recycling mattresses for over 13 years with perfect environmental record."

faqs:
  - question: "Do you really recycle every mattress you pick up in Oak Lawn?"
    answer: "Absolutely! We've recycled over 1 million mattresses nationwide with 100% recycling rate over 13+ years. Every Oak Lawn mattress is processed through certified facilities - springs become construction materials, foam becomes carpet padding, and fabrics enter textile recycling streams."

    answer: "Next-day service is standard throughout Oak Lawn, including historic downtown areas near Trinity Lutheran Church and established neighborhoods along the 95th Street corridor. We coordinate efficiently around community schedules and residential traffic patterns."
  - question: "Can you handle Oak Lawn's diverse housing from 1930s homes to modern subdivisions?"
    answer: "Yes, our 13+ years serving the Chicago area means we're experienced with everything from historic homes with limestone foundations in the original Black Oaks settlement area to contemporary split-levels and ranch-style homes. We bring appropriate equipment for each architectural style."
  - question: "What's included in Oak Lawn's $125 starting price?"

    answer: "Absolutely! We understand Oak Lawn's community calendar including school district events, Village celebrations, and activities at Trinity Lutheran Church and other community centers. Our 13+ years experience includes flexible scheduling around local activities and traffic patterns."
  - question: "How do you handle the Republic Services bulk pickup requirements differently?"
    answer: "While municipal waste services require homeowners to coordinate advance scheduling with Republic Services for bulk items, our professional service handles all logistics directly. We manage pickup timing, transportation, and disposal without requiring homeowner coordination with waste management companies."
  - question: "Are you licensed for Cook County and Worth Township mattress disposal?"
    answer: "Yes, we're fully licensed Cook County and Worth Township haulers working with approved contractors. Unlike basic disposal services, we ensure every mattress reaches certified recycling facilities rather than landfills, supporting Oak Lawn's environmental commitment with our proven 1+ million mattress recycling track record."

    answer: "Yes! Our 3-piece service ($180) includes complete bedroom set removal with professional disassembly. Everything is recycled through our proven processes that have handled over 1 million mattresses nationwide over 13+ years."

  heroDescription: "Oak Lawn's trusted mattress recycling service with over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide. Serving the historic Village of Oak Lawn from Trinity Lutheran's original Black Oaks settlement to modern subdivisions with 13+ years experience."
  aboutService: |
    <p>With over 13 years serving Oak Lawn and 1+ million mattresses recycled nationwide, we're the area's most experienced mattress recycling service. Oak Lawn's 56,101 residents present unique service challenges - from navigating narrow hallways in 1930s limestone foundation homes near Trinity Lutheran Church to accessing split-level and ranch-style homes with attached garages throughout Worth Township's residential areas.</p>
    
    <p>Our team understands Oak Lawn's housing diversity requires specialized equipment. Historic downtown buildings often have narrow staircases and basement access issues, while newer subdivisions feature standard layouts with easier access. We coordinate around the busy 95th Street and Cicero Avenue intersection, work efficiently in residential neighborhoods, and handle everything from Cape Cod style homes to modern bi-levels with professional expertise.</p>
    
    <p>Every mattress we collect in Oak Lawn joins our nationwide recycling achievement of over 1 million mattresses diverted from landfills. Licensed for Cook County and Worth Township operations, we ensure 100% recycling of every pickup while meeting municipal requirements and supporting Oak Lawn's environmental commitment through responsible waste management practices.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "From Oak Lawn's historic downtown district with challenging narrow access to modern subdivisions with standard layouts, our service network covers all residential areas throughout Worth Township:"
  regulationsCompliance: "Working within Cook County and Worth Township regulations, we coordinate with Republic Services municipal contracts while providing independent professional mattress disposal. Unlike standard waste collection requiring homeowner scheduling coordination, we manage all logistics through licensed facilities and certified recycling partners meeting village environmental standards."
  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Oak Lawn's 56,101 residents generate substantial mattress waste, yet our recycling-first approach ensures zero village mattresses reach Cook County landfills. As part of our 1+ million mattresses recycled nationwide over 13+ years, every Oak Lawn pickup contributes to environmental protection through comprehensive materials recovery.</p>
    
    <p>We partner with Cook County facilities and regional recycling centers to process Oak Lawn mattresses into valuable materials - steel springs become new construction materials, memory foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabric components enter textile recycling streams. This circular economy approach supports Oak Lawn's environmental goals while reducing waste impact across Worth Township's residential communities.</p>
    
    <p>From families in historic downtown homes to residents in modern subdivisions throughout the village, all Oak Lawn residents benefit from our environmentally responsible disposal that keeps mattress materials in productive use rather than occupying Cook County landfill space, supporting the community's commitment to sustainable waste management.</p>
