  heroDescription: "Professional mattress removal serving Cheyenne's High Plains community. With over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide, we bring reliable service to Wyoming's capital city."
  aboutService: |
    <p>Getting rid of mattresses in Cheyenne means dealing with the City Transfer Station's limited hours, coordinating around F.E. Warren Air Force Base schedules, or timing service calls between Wyoming's unpredictable weather patterns. We handle these High Plains challenges directly. Our service has processed over 1 million mattresses through our nationwide recycling network, bringing that expertise to your door whether you live in government housing downtown or on a ranch property in the rural 82007 area.</p>

    <p>Cheyenne families call us during major life transitions - military PCS moves from F.E. Warren, job changes in the growing tech sector with Microsoft and Meta expansions, or seasonal mattress upgrades before Wyoming's harsh winter sets in. We understand this capital city's unique rhythm, working around federal and state government schedules, coordinating with military deployment cycles, and planning for the extreme weather swings that define High Plains living at 6,000 feet elevation.</p>

    <p>Instead of loading mattresses into your truck during a spring windstorm or trying to make it to the transfer station before 2:30pm on a weekday, we come directly to you. Our team knows Cheyenne's layout well - from the historic Lincolnway corridor to the expanding data center districts along the business parkway - and we handle proper disposal while you focus on what matters in this blend of Old West heritage and modern technology growth.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "We serve all of Cheyenne, from downtown government buildings to rural High Plains properties, covering every ZIP code in Wyoming's largest city and capital."
  regulationsCompliance: "Wyoming's disposal system requires mattresses to be handled through approved facilities with EPA and RCRA compliance. The City Transfer Station has limited weekday hours and closes early on Saturdays, making it difficult for working families to access. We eliminate the trip to North College Drive, the restricted hours, and the hassle of determining proper disposal methods - just direct, professional pickup service that meets all Wyoming DEQ requirements."
  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Cheyenne sits on Wyoming's High Plains where wind and weather create unique environmental considerations that residents understand well. This awareness extends to responsible disposal practices that keep materials productive rather than adding to regional waste challenges. Our recycling process breaks down mattresses into steel springs, foam, and fabric components for reuse, preventing approximately 65 pounds per mattress from reaching Wyoming landfills.</p>

    <p>About 85% of each mattress we collect gets diverted from Wyoming waste streams and processed into new products through established recycling partnerships. Steel springs become new metal products, foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabrics support textile manufacturing - supporting the resource efficiency values that frontier communities naturally develop.</p>

    <p>For environmentally conscious residents who appreciate Cheyenne's role as Wyoming's governmental and economic center, our service provides a straightforward way to handle mattress disposal responsibly. You know your old mattress is being processed through verified facilities rather than contributing to waste management challenges in this high-elevation plains environment.</p>
