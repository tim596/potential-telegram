faqs:
  - question: "How does pickup work during KU's academic calendar transitions?"
    answer: "We understand university rhythms - finals week, graduation, summer session changes, fall semester move-in. Next-day scheduling works around KU housing deadlines, student move-out periods, and faculty relocations without city scheduling conflicts."
  - question: "Do you serve all Lawrence neighborhoods and KU campus areas?"
    answer: "Absolutely. From Massachusetts Street downtown to KU campus housing, Oread neighborhoods to West Lawrence suburbs - we serve the entire Lawrence community throughout Douglas County."
  - question: "Can you handle University of Kansas housing requirements?"
    answer: "Yes. Our team understands varied student housing - residence halls, apartments, fraternity houses, faculty neighborhoods. We navigate different building access and landlord requirements professionally."
  - question: "What's included beyond basic removal?"
    answer: "Complete service includes pickup from any floor, professional transportation, and 100% mattress recycling. No city scheduling, landlord coordination, or academic deadline pressure."
