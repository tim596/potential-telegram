faqs:
  - question: "Do you work around aviation industry shift schedules?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Wichita's identity as the Air Capital means thousands of aerospace workers on varying shifts at Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems, and Cessna. We offer flexible timing including early morning and evening appointments to accommodate day/night rotations throughout Sedgwick County's aviation corridor."
  - question: "How is your service different from Wichita city bulk pickup?"
    answer: "We eliminate Environmental Services coordination entirely. While Wichita requires advance scheduling through municipal departments with monthly pickup windows, we provide immediate next-day pickup with guaranteed recycling and no administrative coordination needed."
  - question: "Can you handle the greater Wichita metro area efficiently?"
    answer: "Yes. Wichita anchors south-central Kansas with suburbs like Derby, Haysville, and Valley Center. Our service covers all Sedgwick County ZIP codes efficiently and we understand both aviation shift schedules and WSU academic calendar transitions throughout the metro area."
  - question: "What's included in your $125 starting price?"
    answer: "Complete mattress removal from your Wichita home, professional transport, and 100% recycling. Additional charges only for stairs ($10/flight) or extended carries over 75 feet from our truck."
  - question: "Do you really recycle every mattress from Wichita?"
    answer: "Yes, 100% guaranteed. We've recycled over 1 million mattresses nationwide. Your Wichita mattress goes to certified facilities where springs become construction steel, foam becomes carpet padding, and fabrics get recycled into new textiles."
  - question: "How quickly can you schedule pickup in Wichita?"
    answer: "Next-day service is standard throughout the Air Capital metro area. Book online in 60 seconds or call (720) 263-6094. Most pickups can be arranged within 24 hours, often same-day depending on availability."
  - question: "Can you coordinate with aviation shift workers?"
    answer: "Yes, we understand Wichita's role as the Air Capital with thousands of aerospace employees on varied schedules at Boeing, Spirit, and Cessna. We offer flexible timing including early morning and evening appointments to accommodate rotating shifts throughout Sedgwick County's aviation industry."
  - question: "Do you serve WSU students and university housing?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Our service accommodates Wichita State University students transitioning between semesters, plus faculty and staff relocations. We understand academic calendar timing and student housing needs throughout the Shocker community and surrounding neighborhoods."
