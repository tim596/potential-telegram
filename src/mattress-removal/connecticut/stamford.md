# Local regulations content
localRegulations: "Stamford operates under Connecticut's comprehensive mattress stewardship program requiring manufacturer-funded recycling through point-of-sale fees. The city coordinates with Bye Bye Mattress for no-cost disposal at municipal facilities and authorized collection sites. Local waste companies including City Carting & Recycling, Finocchio Brothers, and Oak Ridge Waste partner with state programs for licensed haulers. WIN Waste's Stamford transfer station processes materials through approved recycling channels. Connecticut's program diverts 80-95% of mattress components from landfills through certified dismantling facilities. Professional pickup services must coordinate with dense urban access patterns affecting high-rise buildings and corporate campus logistics."
