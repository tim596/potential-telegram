  heroDescription: "A Bedder World provides professional mattress removal throughout New Haven's diverse university and residential communities. From Yale campus housing to historic East Rock homes and downtown apartments, we handle pickup, loading, and transport to certified recycling facilities with the reliability expected in Connecticut's premier university city."
  
  aboutService: "New Haven's unique character as Connecticut's premier university city, anchored by Yale's $7 billion annual economic impact and home to over 132,000 residents, creates distinctive mattress removal needs across academic and residential communities. The East Rock neighborhood, known as 'Grad Haven,' serves Yale graduate students, faculty, and young professionals in historic Victorian homes requiring careful navigation of period features and narrow staircases. Downtown's high-rise apartments and condos near the New Haven Green demand coordination with building management and urban parking logistics. Westville's historic village atmosphere features 1920s colonials and family homes requiring respectful handling of original architectural elements. The university district serves student housing, dormitories, and off-campus apartments with semester-driven schedules demanding flexible service around academic calendars. New Haven's biotech corridor, housing over 70 companies, includes corporate housing for healthcare and research professionals. Our comprehensive recycling approach works with Connecticut's regional facilities to ensure every mattress is properly processed, supporting the city's environmental consciousness and university sustainability standards."
