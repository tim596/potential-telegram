Residents can access the Fargo Landfill (M-F 7:15am-5pm, Sat 7:15am-1pm) but mattresses require special arrangements. West Fargo Sanitation Division at 701-515-5400 provides regular waste collection but mattresses are not included in standard curbside pickup service. City requires items be separated properly and may charge additional fees for bulky disposal."

      text: "We moved to West Fargo from Minnesota last year when my husband got a position at one of the agricultural equipment companies. The moving process was complicated enough without having to figure out North Dakota's waste disposal requirements. This mattress removal service was a lifesaver when our moving truck delivered our new bedroom set a day early and we needed the old mattresses gone immediately. The crew arrived within two hours of our call, carefully navigated our suburban driveway, and handled both our queen mattress and box spring professionally. The $165 total was completely worth avoiding the drive to the Fargo landfill and figuring out their hours and fees ourselves. They understood that we were new to the area and needed things done efficiently while we were still getting settled."
