      text: "Honestly wasn't sure what to expect but these guys were super professional. Had to get a king mattress and box spring out of my second-floor bedroom before the landlord inspection. They brought the right equipment, wrapped everything properly, and even swept up after. The $155 was exactly what they quoted - no surprise fees or anything. Really appreciated how they handled the narrow staircase without banging up the walls."

      text: "My buddy recommended them after his move and I'm glad he did! We've got this older memory foam mattress that's been sitting in the basement for months since we upgraded. Called them on Tuesday, they came out Wednesday morning. Two-person crew was really efficient - in and out in maybe 15 minutes total. They explained how they recycle the materials which was cool to hear. Definitely worth the money."

  heroDescription: "Mattress removal specialists serving Warren's 134,000 residents. From Tech Center high-rises to post-war ranch homes, we extract and recycle every mattress type starting at just $125."

  aboutService: |
    <p>Warren's legacy as the "Tool and Die Capital of the World" shaped its unique housing patterns - and our mattress removal expertise adapts to each one. Whether extracting king-size memory foam from Arsenal of Democracy-era bungalows or maneuvering bulky innersprings down narrow stairwells in Van Dyke Avenue complexes, our crews deliver complete removal with 85% materials recovery. Every pickup diverts mattress components from Michigan landfills while supporting the regional manufacturing economy.</p>
    
    <p>Steel coil extraction drives our competitive advantage. Those innerspring components travel directly to Warren Steel Works and similar Detroit-area facilities, becoming raw material for automotive parts and construction beams. Meanwhile, memory foam transforms into acoustic insulation for GM's Technical Center projects, while cotton batting becomes industrial-grade wiping materials. This circular economy approach means Warren residents contribute directly to regional manufacturing renewal.</p>
    
    <p>Logistics matter in a city where Chrysler's transmission plant and GM's Tech Center dictate traffic patterns. Our scheduling coordinates around 7 AM and 3:30 PM shift changes, avoiding Mound Road congestion while ensuring school zone compliance near Warren Woods Elementary and Lincoln High. Each crew carries Republic Services-approved wrapping materials and navigates everything from Heritage Village's mature subdivisions to newer apartment developments along Chicago Road.</p>

  serviceAreasIntro: "Every Warren neighborhood presents distinct removal challenges. Our specialists navigate everything from tight Heritage Village driveways to complex apartment access near Macomb Community College, plus high-security protocols around GM's sprawling Technical Center campus."

  regulationsCompliance: "Our Warren team ensures compliance with all local disposal requirements, including mandatory plastic wrapping and coordination with authorized waste management services. We handle the paperwork and preparation so your mattress meets city standards."

  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Warren's manufacturing DNA makes mattress recycling especially meaningful here. Spring steel from your old Sealy becomes feedstock for Chrysler transmission components just miles away. Polyurethane foam finds new life as acoustic dampening in GM prototype vehicles. Even cotton ticking transforms into precision cleaning cloths for Warren's precision tool shops.</p>
    
    <p>This hyperlocal recycling network keeps 85% of materials within a 50-mile radius, supporting Warren's economic revival while preventing landfill waste. Your discarded mattress literally becomes part of the automotive supply chain that built this city - a fitting end for bedroom furniture in the "Tool and Die Capital of the World."</p>
