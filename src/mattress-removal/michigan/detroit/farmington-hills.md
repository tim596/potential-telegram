We've recycled over 1 million mattresses nationwide, supporting this established suburban community's commitment to convenience and environmental responsibility.

  serviceAreasIntro: "Comprehensive mattress pickup throughout Farmington Hills' prestigious neighborhoods - from Rolling Oaks to Briarwood Village:"
  regulationsCompliance: "Farmington Hills operates under Oakland County waste management guidelines with Priority Waste providing municipal collection services. While residents can schedule bulk pickup through the Division of Public Works (248-871-2850), our private service offers immediate scheduling and comprehensive handling of all disposal requirements, ensuring full compliance with county recycling standards."
  environmentalImpact: "Every Farmington Hills mattress supports the community's environmental stewardship through our proven recycling network. This established suburb values sustainability alongside convenience - our systematic material recovery transforms discarded mattresses into reusable components just like the city transforms historical preservation with modern innovation. Steel springs become manufacturing materials, foam converts to industrial products, and wood transforms into landscaping materials for the city's 600+ acres of public parks, achieving 75% recovery rates that align with Farmington Hills' commitment to responsible suburban living."
  howItWorksScheduling: "Flexible scheduling designed for Farmington Hills' busy community needs - from residents commuting to Detroit to families enjoying Heritage Park activities. We accommodate weekend family time and the convenience expectations of this established suburban community across 33.6 square miles."
  howItWorksService: "Our licensed teams navigate Farmington Hills' diverse housing stock - from Brady Bunch era ranch homes in Rolling Oaks to contemporary colonials in Green Hill Commons, established condominiums in Briarwood Village to large apartment complexes throughout the city. We understand suburban subdivision logistics, complex elevator access, and coordination requirements in both family neighborhoods and multi-unit buildings throughout this well-planned suburban community."
  howItWorksDisposal: "Your Farmington Hills mattress enters our nationwide environmental program that has processed over 1 million mattresses. Components receive certified processing through specialized facilities where materials support Michigan's manufacturing economy - steel returns to industrial production, foam becomes commercial cushioning, and textiles join sustainable manufacturing streams, creating a circular economy that honors metro Detroit's industrial heritage while serving the suburban lifestyle that defines this prosperous Oakland County community."

    "text": "Perfect service for our Heritage Park neighborhood home! We were renovating our 1980s ranch and had two old mattresses that needed to go. The team was incredibly professional and worked around our busy schedules - my husband travels for work and I have back-to-back client meetings all week. They showed up exactly when promised, handled everything quickly and cleanly, and you could tell they understand the quality standards that Farmington Hills residents expect. Worth every dollar for the convenience.",

    "text": "So we just moved to Farmington Hills from Chicago for my husband's job at Ford, and honestly the whole suburban Detroit thing is pretty new to us. Had no idea how waste pickup worked here, plus we had this giant king mattress from our old place that wasn't going to fit in our new bedroom layout. Found these guys online and they made everything super simple - just booked it, they showed up when they said they would, and handled the whole thing professionally. Really appreciate that they know the area well and understand that people here value quality service. Made settling into our new Rolling Oaks neighborhood that much easier!",
