    - text: "Honestly wasn't sure what to expect when I booked this service, but WOW! The team showed up exactly when promised, and I have to say - watching them navigate our townhome's narrow stairwell was like watching professionals at work. They had this system down pat, used furniture pads to protect our walls, and even cleaned up a few scuff marks that were already there. My wife was impressed, which doesn't happen often with service calls. The whole experience from booking to completion took less than 24 hours, and knowing our old mattress is being recycled instead of sitting in a landfill makes us both feel good about the choice."
