localRegulations: "Draper residents face unique mattress disposal challenges due to the city's location across Salt Lake County and Utah County lines. In Salt Lake County portions, residents must transport mattresses to the Salt Lake County Landfill paying $18 per piece, with mattresses required to be dry and bedbug-free, or use Salt Lake City's Call 2 Haul program (if eligible) allowing two bulky waste collections annually. Utah County residents must navigate the South Utah Valley Solid Waste District transfer station with current rate schedule pricing, where up to four mattresses are included in dump loads but mattresses cannot be placed in standard dumpsters due to bulky waste restrictions. Both counties prohibit curbside mattress disposal, requiring advance coordination, transportation to designated facilities, and compliance with different fee structures and material preparation requirements. Residents must first determine their county jurisdiction, research applicable regulations, arrange transportation, and pay disposal fees ranging from $18-20 per mattress plus transportation costs. Our professional mattress removal service eliminates these county-specific complications entirely - no jurisdiction research, no facility transportation, no fee navigation, and no material preparation requirements. We provide streamlined online booking with immediate next-day pickup at a single transparent price, bypassing both Salt Lake and Utah County's complex disposal frameworks completely."
