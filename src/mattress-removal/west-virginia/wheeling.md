  aboutService: |
    <p>Wheeling sits along the Ohio River in West Virginia's northern panhandle, home to 27,000 residents in a region that blends Appalachian heritage with modern healthcare and education. From WVU Medicine Wheeling Hospital's 1,200+ employees to Wheeling University's campus community, this river valley city serves as a regional hub. We handle everything from Wheeling Island apartment moves to downtown historic building clearances, working around the area's unique geography and community rhythms.</p>

    <p>Our professional mattress removal service has recycled over 1 million mattresses through our nationwide recycling network, bringing this expertise to Wheeling's distinctive needs - healthcare workers managing shift schedules at WVU Medicine, students transitioning at Wheeling University and West Virginia Northern Community College, and families navigating the hilly terrain from Elm Grove to the river's edge. Whether it's coordinating around Orrick's business operations, clearing university housing, or handling moves near Oglebay Resort, we adapt to this tight-knit valley community.</p>

    <p>Skip the hassle of coordinating Ohio County bulk pickup or navigating bridge access to disposal sites. We handle direct removal from any neighborhood - including Wheeling Island - manage the challenging hill country terrain, and ensure proper disposal through regional facilities while you focus on work, family, or enjoying the Ohio River valley's recreational opportunities.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "Our comprehensive Wheeling coverage spans the entire Ohio River valley, from Wheeling Island across the bridges to hillside neighborhoods, serving West Virginia's northern panhandle hub."

  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Wheeling's Ohio River valley community benefits from advanced mattress recycling practices that support both regional environmental stewardship and Appalachian sustainability values. West Virginia's northern panhandle waste management system processes materials through specialized recycling facilities, recovering steel springs, memory foam components, and textiles for industrial reuse applications.</p>

    <p>Working directly with Ohio County services and state-approved facilities, we ensure 85% of mattress materials avoid landfill disposal through established recycling networks. Our process supports Wheeling's environmental responsibility, from Ohio River watershed protection to preserving the natural beauty that draws visitors to Oglebay Resort and the surrounding valley.</p>

    <p>For healthcare professionals, students, families, and all residents committed to environmental responsibility, our service provides measurable waste diversion that supports both personal and community sustainability goals. Each mattress processed represents approximately 65 pounds of material recovered through approved recycling channels rather than contributing to regional waste concerns.</p>
