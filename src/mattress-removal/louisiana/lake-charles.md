    - text: "Hurricane season prep required clearing space in our garage and we had two old mattresses taking up half the room. Working at Memorial Hospital means weird schedules, but they accommodated my 3 PM availability perfectly. Quick, professional, and they actually recycle everything which matters in our coastal community that's seen too much storm debris."
