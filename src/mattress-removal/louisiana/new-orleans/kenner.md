    - text: "These folks were a lifesaver after Hurricane Ida damage! Had two water-damaged mattresses that needed immediate removal while we were dealing with insurance and contractors. Called Thursday morning and they came Friday afternoon exactly as promised. Professional crew, understood the post-storm cleanup challenges we were facing. Fair pricing with no gouging despite high demand. Highly recommend to anyone dealing with storm damage cleanup."
