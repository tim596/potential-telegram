  aboutService: "Medford's specialized mattress removal service, designed for Boston's most authentic suburban community. With 59,062 residents in this historic riverside city, we serve everyone from West Medford commuter families to Wellington's dense apartment districts. Our team understands Medford's unique character as a working-class suburb that maintains its industrial heritage while welcoming diverse communities and Tufts University students.

  regulationsCompliance: "As a specialized mattress removal service with over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide, we provide professional alternatives to Medford's municipal options. Our service eliminates the complexity of coordinating HandUp pickups, waiting for Tuesday bulk collection, or transporting items to disposal sites.

For working families and busy residents, our door-to-door service provides convenience while exceeding Massachusetts disposal ban requirements through certified recycling."
