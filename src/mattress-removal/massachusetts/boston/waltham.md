      neighborhood: "Chemistry"
    - text: "Three-family house from the 1920s, steep front stairs, narrow hallways. My elderly neighbor needed her bedroom mattress replaced but couldn't handle city pickup requirements. I called these folks - they coordinated with all three families, took care of protective coverings for our shared entryway."

      neighborhood: "South Waltham"
    - text: "Moving out of student housing always stressful but this was actually easy. Called Wednesday, they came Friday morning before my parents arrived to help pack the car. The team was really understanding about college move-out chaos and even helped coordinate timing with my roommate who also needed pickup. Definitely recommend to other students dealing with end-of-semester furniture situations."

  serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress removal serves all Waltham neighborhoods and districts, from university areas to biotech facilities:"
  regulationsCompliance: "Waltham's DPW requires residents to schedule bulk waste pickup through city coordination, often involving advance notice and specific preparation steps that don't align with university academic schedules or busy work patterns. Our independent service eliminates these municipal requirements entirely - we handle pickup, transportation, and recycling without city scheduling, preparation steps, or timing restrictions. This means no coordinating collection dates around academic calendars, no managing dormitory move-out logistics with city schedules, and no compliance with municipal preparation requirements. Simply book online and we handle everything, letting you focus on work, academic commitments, and family responsibilities."
