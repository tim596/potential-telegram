      text: "Called on Wednesday for a king mattress pickup from our master bedroom. The team arrived Thursday morning exactly on time, wrapped everything properly to protect our hardwood floors, and completed the removal in under 20 minutes. Much easier than driving to the Twin Oaks facility and dealing with the county's waste separation requirements ourselves. The $135 fee was completely worth avoiding that hassle, especially since my husband travels frequently for work at Lowe's corporate and doesn't have time for dump runs."
