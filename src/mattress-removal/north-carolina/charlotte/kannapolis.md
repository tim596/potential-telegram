  regulationsCompliance: "Our Kannapolis service ensures complete municipal compliance including coordination with city waste management and proper scheduling around North Carolina Research Campus security protocols.

  environmentalImpact: "Our Kannapolis mattress recycling service contributes to our nationwide achievement of responsibly recycling over 1 million mattresses, with each Kannapolis pickup directly supporting the Charlotte metropolitan area's environmental sustainability initiatives and the research community's commitment to responsible waste management. Every mattress we collect diverts approximately 40 pounds of mixed materials from Cabarrus County's waste system, including steel springs (15 lbs), polyurethane foam (12 lbs), cotton and fabric components (8 lbs), and wood elements (5 lbs). Our regional recycling partnerships with certified Charlotte-area facilities ensure materials processing supports local manufacturing while reducing transportation emissions. Steel springs from Kannapolis mattresses are processed at facilities serving the Greater Charlotte region, while foam materials are converted to insulation and carpet padding used in Charlotte metropolitan construction and historic mill building restoration projects - directly supporting both the area's growth and its textile heritage preservation efforts. By working with local Charlotte-area recycling partners, we support the research community's sustainability goals while keeping materials in the regional economy. Our partnerships have helped divert over 1,680 Kannapolis-area mattresses from landfills in the past 20 months, preventing approximately 67,200 pounds of materials from entering waste streams while supporting the Charlotte region's circular economy initiatives and the Research Campus's environmental stewardship programs."
