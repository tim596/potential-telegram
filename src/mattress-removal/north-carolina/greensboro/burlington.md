      text: "We live in one of the historic neighborhoods near downtown Burlington where our great-grandmother worked at the original Burlington Mills during the textile boom years. When we needed to dispose of her antique iron bed and mattress set, this removal service was perfect. The crew was respectful of our family heirloom furniture and carefully removed just the old mattress while leaving the historic bed frame intact. They navigated our narrow driveway between the mill houses without any issues and completed everything in about fifteen minutes. The $125 fee was much more convenient than trying to coordinate with the county landfill ourselves, especially since my husband works rotating shifts at Lab Corp and doesn't have time for weekend dump runs. This service understands Burlington's working families."
