localRegulations: "Cary mattress disposal requires coordination with Wake County Solid Waste Management at 919-856-7400. Town does not provide curbside mattress pickup - residents must use Wake County facilities or private services. North Wake Multi-Material Recycling Facility at 9029 Deponie Drive, Raleigh accepts some materials but mattresses require special arrangements. Wake County operates three Multi-Material Recycling Facilities but encourages private pickup services for bulky items like mattresses."

      text: "We moved to Cary two years ago when my husband got a position at one of the Research Triangle Park companies. Finding reliable home services in this tech-focused area has been surprisingly challenging, but this mattress removal service exceeded our expectations. They scheduled around our busy work schedules at different RTP companies, arrived exactly on time for our Saturday morning appointment, and professionally removed both our king mattress and box spring without any hassle. The $165 total was completely reasonable compared to trying to navigate Wake County's disposal system ourselves, especially since we both work long hours and don't have time for facility trips. The crew understood the upscale neighborhood requirements and treated our home with the respect you'd expect in Lochmere. Great service for busy professionals."
