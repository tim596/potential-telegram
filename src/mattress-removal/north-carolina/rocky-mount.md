      text: "We live in one of the historic Rocky Mount Mills houses that's been in our family for three generations - those narrow Victorian staircases weren't built for modern king-size mattresses. This removal team handled the challenge perfectly, carefully maneuvering our old mattress down the tight stairwell without damaging any of the original woodwork our great-grandfather installed when he worked at the textile mills. They understood the historic significance of our neighborhood and treated our home with the respect it deserved. The $135 fee was reasonable, especially considering we didn't have to figure out which county facility to use or deal with the different disposal requirements on either side of the railroad tracks. Professional service that gets Rocky Mount's unique character."
