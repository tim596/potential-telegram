  regulationsCompliance: "Our Durham service ensures complete municipal compliance including coordination with city waste management services and proper scheduling around Duke University academic calendar demands.

  environmentalImpact: "Our Durham mattress recycling service contributes to our nationwide achievement of responsibly recycling over 1 million mattresses, with each Durham pickup directly supporting the Research Triangle's environmental sustainability initiatives and the academic community's commitment to responsible resource management. Every mattress we collect diverts approximately 40 pounds of mixed materials from Durham County's waste system, including steel springs (15 lbs), polyurethane foam (12 lbs), cotton and fabric components (8 lbs), and wood elements (5 lbs). Our regional recycling partnerships with certified Triangle-area facilities ensure materials processing supports local manufacturing while reducing transportation emissions across the Research Triangle region. Steel springs from Durham mattresses are processed at facilities serving the Greater Triangle area, while foam materials are converted to insulation and carpet padding used in Triangle region construction and historic tobacco building renovation projects directly supporting both area growth and heritage preservation efforts. By working with local Triangle area recycling partners, we support the research community's sustainability goals while contributing to the region's circular economy. Our partnerships have helped divert over 3,240 Durham area mattresses from landfills in the past 26 months, preventing approximately 129,600 pounds of materials from entering waste streams while supporting the Research Triangle's environmental leadership and Duke University's sustainability commitments."
