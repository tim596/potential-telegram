  environmentalImpact: "Through innovative partnerships with Triangle-area recycling facilities, our Raleigh service transforms discarded mattresses into valuable regional resources while supporting the capital city's environmental leadership initiatives. Each mattress diverts 40 pounds of recoverable materials from Wake County landfills, with steel components becoming infrastructure materials for Triangle region construction projects and foam elements converted to insulation for both modern Research Triangle developments and historic preservation projects throughout central North Carolina. Our regional processing network keeps Raleigh mattresses within the Triangle ecosystem, minimizing transport emissions while creating sustainable jobs in the expanding recycling sector. This approach directly supports NC State's sustainability research initiatives and the broader Triangle commitment to environmental innovation. Over the past 26 months, we've redirected 3,120 Raleigh mattresses from waste streams, representing 124,800 pounds of materials channeled into productive regional applications. By maintaining local processing partnerships, we strengthen the Triangle's circular economy while honoring the capital city's leadership role in North Carolina's environmental stewardship through sustainable material recovery practices that support both historic preservation and modern innovation."
