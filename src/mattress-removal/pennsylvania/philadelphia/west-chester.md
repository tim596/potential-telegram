localRegulations: "West Chester Borough provides bulk item collection with mattresses and box springs requiring a $35 fee per item and advance scheduling through their Bulk Trash Form system at 205 Lacey Street, with pickup coordinated after application submission. Chester County Solid Waste Authority accepts mattresses at their facilities during operating hours as an alternative disposal method. As Chester County's seat with 18,671 residents and home to West Chester University's 17,000 students, mattress disposal timing becomes critical during semester transitions, graduation periods, and summer housing turnovers when student apartments generate high volumes requiring rapid processing beyond standard municipal collection schedules."

Whether you live in the East End's diverse neighborhoods, near WCU's campus in student housing districts, or in the courthouse square area surrounded by 1840s architecture, we understand the practical needs of Pennsylvania's premier college town with deep governmental and educational roots.
