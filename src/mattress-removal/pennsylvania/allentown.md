localRegulations: "Allentown provides weekly bulk item collection allowing one mattress or furniture piece per week on the second collection night (Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday) of designated collection zones at no additional charge. The city's Public Works Department at 641 S. 10th Street manages solid waste collection with specific guidelines that bulk items like mattresses cannot exceed pickup capacity and must be placed curbside on the designated second collection night only. As Pennsylvania's third-largest city with 125,320 residents and the Lehigh Valley's economic center, Allentown's waste management coordinates with growing urban density, diverse housing stock from historic downtown to suburban developments, and the challenge of serving both established neighborhoods and rapidly expanding commercial districts throughout the metropolitan area."

Whether you live near the PPL Center's entertainment district, the Airport District's commercial developments, or residential neighborhoods throughout North and South Side areas, we understand the practical needs of the Lehigh Valley's most populous city and regional business hub.
