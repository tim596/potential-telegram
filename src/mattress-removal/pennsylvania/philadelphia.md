      neighborhood: "Fishtown"

localRegulations: "Philadelphia residents must comply with city requirements for mattress disposal including mandatory plastic wrapping for curbside pickup and a two-item weekly limit for large items. The city's new 2024 bulk collection program specifically excludes mattresses, requiring continued use of regular trash collection. Bed bug regulations require landlords to address infestations within 10 days with $2,000 penalties for non-compliance. Philadelphia provides six convenience centers for unwrapped mattress drop-off with resident ID, but these operate limited hours Monday-Saturday. Our professional service eliminates these disposal complications by handling all city regulation compliance, providing plastic wrapping service, working within row house architectural constraints, offering flexible scheduling beyond city collection days, and supporting Pennsylvania's environmental goals through certified recycling partnerships that demonstrate Philadelphia's commitment to sustainable urban living."
