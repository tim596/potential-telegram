Each mattress pickup prevents 40 pounds of waste while supporting sustainable practices that protect the agricultural landscape surrounding Lebanon. After serving Lebanon's manufacturing workers and farming families, we've recycled 920 mattresses (36,800 pounds) that directly support the environmental values essential to Pennsylvania Dutch Country's agricultural heritage. This regional processing approach reduces transport emissions while creating jobs that serve Lebanon's economic base of manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare that make this a vital south-central Pennsylvania community. By choosing professional mattress removal, Lebanon families and businesses contribute to sustainability initiatives that preserve the farmland and natural resources that define Pennsylvania Dutch Country's character and economic foundation."
