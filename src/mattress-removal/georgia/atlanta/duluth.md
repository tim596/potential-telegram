      text: "Fantastic experience with mattress pickup at our gated estate. The crew understood our community's access protocols and worked seamlessly with our gatehouse security. They handled our California king from the master suite without scuffing our hardwood floors. Worth every penny for the convenience."

      text: "Booked online Tuesday evening and had pickup scheduled for Thursday morning. The team showed up right at 9 AM as promised and quickly loaded our old queen mattress and box spring from the second floor. Super efficient and much easier than dealing with Gwinnett County bulk pickup schedules."

      text: "Moving day was crazy enough without worrying about mattress disposal. These folks took care of everything - showed up during our specified window, grabbed both kids' twin mattresses from upstairs, and were gone in fifteen minutes. Professional service that made our relocation stress-free."
