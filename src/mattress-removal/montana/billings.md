faqs:

  heroDescription: "Professional mattress pickup and recycling serving Montana's Magic City. Part of our nationwide network that has recycled over 1 million mattresses, with next-day service for Yellowstone River valley communities."
  aboutService: "Need professional mattress removal in Billings? We provide guaranteed recycling through our nationwide network that has processed over 1 million mattresses sustainably. Our service covers all of Montana's largest city from the Yellowstone Valley downtown core to The Heights residential areas above the dramatic rimrocks. As Montana's regional hub serving 400,000+ people across four states, Billings residents deserve eco-friendly disposal that matches the community's commitment to energy industry sustainability and environmental stewardship. Whether you're managing housing for energy sector workers, coordinating moves for healthcare professionals at Billings Clinic or St. Vincent, or upgrading furniture in new developments like Paintbrush Place, we ensure your mattresses become valuable raw materials rather than landfill waste. Our Montana service understands both the Magic City's industrial heritage and modern environmental leadership."
  serviceAreasIntro: "From the historic Yellowstone Valley to modern Heights developments above Montana's famous rimrocks, our eco-friendly pickup reaches every household in the state's energy and healthcare capital:"
  regulationsCompliance: "Billings residents benefit from comprehensive municipal waste collection and Republic Services' modern recycling facilities processing regional materials. However, Montana lacks the mattress stewardship programs operating in California, Oregon, and Connecticut. While the city maintains excellent general waste management, specialized mattress recycling requires certified private services. Our documented sustainable disposal supports Billings' environmental leadership and energy industry sustainability commitments. With 121,000+ residents in Montana's largest city serving a four-state region, our eco-friendly approach offers the specialized recycling service that supports the community's role as the state's environmental and industrial leader."
  environmentalImpact: "Our Billings service connects to a nationwide recycling network that has diverted over 1 million mattresses from landfills. Each mattress generates approximately 75 pounds of steel for construction projects, 15 pounds of foam for carpet padding production, and fabric for insulation manufacturing. This circular economy approach supports Montana's environmental goals while providing documentation that energy companies, healthcare systems, and environmentally conscious residents require. We partner with Montana regional processing facilities and Big Sky scrap metal recovery networks, creating local economic value from Billings' waste stream while supporting the community's commitment to energy industry sustainability and environmental stewardship leadership."
  howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day eco-friendly appointments throughout greater Billings. We coordinate around energy sector crew changes, Billings Clinic medical schedules, and agricultural processing operations that serve Montana's regional economy."
  howItWorksService: "Professional environmental team provides curbside collection using eco-equipped vehicles. We handle downtown Yellowstone Valley properties and Heights residential areas with equal expertise in sustainable practices and Montana's unique geographic challenges."
  howItWorksDisposal: "Your mattress enters our documented recycling network where 90%+ of materials become new products. Steel components go to regional processing facilities, while foam supports manufacturing - complete environmental accountability supporting Billings' leadership in Montana's energy and environmental sectors."
