      text: "Our daughter graduated from Lincoln and left her dorm mattress behind. A Bedder World handled the pickup during the crazy move-out week when the university charges fees for abandoned furniture. They coordinated with campus housing and got everything sorted out quickly. Really saved us from having to drive down from Kansas City to deal with it ourselves - the $125 was totally worth avoiding that headache."

      text: "We live in one of the historic German houses in Old Munichburg and were worried about getting a king mattress down the narrow 1800s staircase without damaging the original woodwork. The A Bedder World team was fantastic - they brought padding and took their time to protect everything. They understood that we couldn't just drag it out and potentially damage a historic home that's been in our family for four generations. Professional service that respected both our property and our neighborhood's heritage. Plus they actually recycle the mattresses instead of just hauling them to a landfill, which aligns with our environmental values as longtime Missouri residents who care about preserving our state's natural resources."
