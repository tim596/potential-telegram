localRegulations: Chesterfield Municipal Code Chapter 235 requires waste containers stored behind building lines, invisible from public right-of-way, with all bulk waste routed through licensed facilities. Republic Services holds exclusive residential contract at $15.31/month ($13.01 seniors). City regulations mandate 7-day maximum bulk waste storage with mandatory licensed hauler removal for oversized items. Many subdivision CC&Rs and HOA covenants add storage visibility restrictions beyond municipal requirements, creating liability for improper mattress disposal.

      text: "We were upgrading from a full to king size and needed the old mattress gone before delivery. Called A Bedder World on Thursday, they picked it up Friday morning. The team was professional, got it out of our upstairs bedroom without any issues with the stairs or walls. Really appreciated that they actually recycle the materials instead of just dumping everything in a landfill like some other companies do."

      text: "My elderly mother was downsizing from her Chesterfield home and we had three mattresses that needed to go - hers plus two guest room mattresses that hadn't been used in years. A Bedder World was incredibly patient and helpful, working around the estate sale schedule and handling all the awkward doorways in her 1980s split-level. The pricing was fair at $125 each, and they provided documentation showing the mattresses went to proper recycling facilities, which was important to mom since she's always been environmentally conscious. The whole process took about 20 minutes and they cleaned up after themselves. Would definitely recommend them to other families dealing with similar transitions."
