      text: "Washington University hospital relocation meant our king mattress disposal couldn't wait for monthly bulk pickup. A Bedder World handled Central West End high-rise access permits and elevator coordination perfectly. They provided recycling documentation our building manager needed for environmental compliance - professional service that prevented potential violation issues."

      text: "Our historic Soulard row house stairs defeated three other removal services. A Bedder World brought specialized equipment and understood city weight restrictions. Most importantly, they actually recycle through Earthbound facility instead of making empty eco-claims like competitors. Got disposal certificates proving environmental responsibility."

Their team understood Clayton building policies and eliminated liability concerns. The recycling certificates satisfied our property management's sustainability requirements."
faqs:
  - question: How quickly can you pick up mattresses in St. Louis?
    answer: We offer next-day service throughout the St. Louis metro area. Same-day pickup is often available for urgent situations in high-density areas like Central West End or Clayton. Call (720) 263-6094 to check availability for your specific neighborhood.
  - question: Do you serve both St. Louis city and county?
    answer: Yes, we serve the entire St. Louis metropolitan area including city proper and all county municipalities. We understand the different waste regulations between city and county jurisdictions and handle compliance accordingly.
  - question: Can you navigate historic St. Louis buildings?
    answer: Absolutely. Our team specializes in St. Louis's unique housing stock - from narrow Soulard row houses to converted downtown lofts. We carry specialized equipment for tight staircases, freight elevators, and challenging access situations throughout the metro area.
  - question: What's included in your St. Louis mattress removal pricing?
    answer: Pricing starts at $125 for single mattresses, $125 for queen, $135 for king, with $30 for additional box springs. This includes pickup anywhere on your property, proper wrapping, transportation, and eco-friendly disposal or recycling.
  - question: Do you actually recycle mattresses in St. Louis?
    answer: Unlike competitors making vague 'eco-friendly' claims, we provide actual recycling through Earthbound Recycling in Eureka - the metro's only dedicated mattress facility. We transport materials there and provide recycling certificates proving 80% material recovery. This addresses Missouri's lack of mattress landfill bans while supporting our 1+ million mattresses recycled nationwide. Property managers receive documentation for sustainability compliance.
  - question: How do you handle university area pickups?
    answer: We coordinate with Washington University, SLU, and UMSL during peak move-out periods when universities charge $50 for abandoned furniture. Our team understands seasonal enforcement patterns in University City, navigates limited parking during graduation periods, and provides the compliance documentation students need to avoid abandonment fees. We work around academic calendars when bulk pickup availability is most limited.
  - question: Are you licensed for commercial mattress removal in Missouri?
    answer: Yes, we maintain Missouri Department of Natural Resources permits for solid waste transportation, unlike unlicensed competitors who create liability risks under Ordinance 71574. Our licensing ensures Environmental Investigations Unit compliance, protects property owners from tenant violation liability under Missouri § 441.630, and provides the insurance coverage needed for high-rise buildings and corporate facilities throughout Clayton and Central West End.
  - question: What makes your service different from city bulk pickup?
    answer: St. Louis bulk pickup restricts you to 3 items monthly ($14 fee), requires 6 AM Monday placement, and has 100-pound weight limits. We eliminate these restrictions with immediate next-day service, handle building access permits that city crews can't, and provide actual recycling certificates vs. landfill disposal. No dealing with Environmental Investigations Unit camera surveillance or violation risks.
