      text: "Called them when we were moving out of our Valencia place and needed our king mattress gone fast. The crew showed up right on time and handled everything perfectly - even navigating our narrow stairs with no issues. Really professional service and the pricing was exactly what they quoted over the phone. Would definitely use them again."

      text: "Had an old memory foam mattress and box spring that needed to go after we upgraded our bedroom. The guys were super efficient and even swept up afterwards. Living in Old Town Newhall with those older homes, I was worried about them getting it through the tight doorways, but they knew exactly what they were doing. Great experience overall."

      text: "We had two mattresses and a couple bed frames to get rid of when we downsized. They scheduled us for the next day which was perfect since we were in a time crunch. The team was friendly and worked quickly - in and out in about 15 minutes. Really appreciated how they handled everything carefully and didn't track any dirt through the house."
