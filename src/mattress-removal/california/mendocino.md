  heroSubtitle: " • Historic Property Specialists • Serving Coastal Victorian Village"
  heroDescription: "A Bedder World provides specialized mattress removal throughout Mendocino's historic Victorian village and coastal residential areas. From century-old inns to artist studios, we handle heritage property access challenges with next-day scheduling and eco-friendly disposal that preserves this treasured coastal community."
  
  aboutService: "Mendocino's unique position as a Victorian-era coastal village creates distinctive mattress disposal needs. The community's 932 residents maintain one of California's most intact 19th-century streetscapes, where many buildings date to the 1850s logging boom. The area attracts retirees (median age 68) seeking coastal preservation lifestyles. Historic properties feature narrow hallways, steep staircases, and century-old doorways that require specialized removal expertise. The community's hospitality sector - numerous B&Bs and boutique inns - drives frequent mattress replacement cycles tied to guest experience standards and heritage building maintenance requirements."
  
  serviceAreasIntro: "Mendocino's coastal geography creates unique access considerations across neighborhoods. The Main Street Commercial District offers the most direct access for efficient removals, while blufftop properties require careful navigation of clifftop locations and seasonal weather exposure. Ford House Area and Kelley House Historic District properties demand extra care around museum-quality architectural details and visitor access coordination."
  
  environmentalImpact: "Mendocino County's commitment to coastal preservation aligns perfectly with responsible mattress disposal practices. The area's connection to California's Bye Bye Mattress stewardship program ensures materials avoid Pacific Ocean contamination through proper recycling channels. Redwood Waste Solutions' Caspar facility provides local processing that prevents illegal dumping along scenic Highway 1, supporting the pristine coastal environment that defines Mendocino's UNESCO World Heritage-caliber landscape."
  
  pricingContext: "Mendocino's hospitality economy and historic property considerations create specific pricing needs. B&B proprietors appreciate transparent pricing that accommodates heritage building access challenges without surprise charges.
