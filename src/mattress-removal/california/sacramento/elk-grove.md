      text: "Perfect timing for our move from Laguna West. They showed up exactly when promised, handled three kids' mattresses plus the master bedroom set without any hassle. The crew was super careful going down our stairs and around the corner - no scuff marks or damage. My husband was at work, so I really appreciated how professional and efficient they were. Definitely calling them again when we replace the guest room mattress next year."

      text: "Really impressed with their service in Stonelake. Had an old king-size mattress on the second floor that was a nightmare to get up there originally. These guys made it look easy getting it out. They brought the right equipment, protected our hardwood floors, and were done in under 20 minutes. The online booking was straightforward too - much better than the other companies I called that wanted to give me vague time windows."

      text: "Needed same-day removal for a mattress that got damaged in our Elk Grove Meadows home. They couldn't do true same-day but got us scheduled first thing the next morning. The team arrived right at 8 AM, got everything loaded quickly, and even swept up some debris that fell off the old mattress. Fair price and honest communication about timing. Would definitely use them again."
