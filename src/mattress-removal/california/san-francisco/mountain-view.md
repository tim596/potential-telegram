localRegulations: "Mountain View operates under Alameda County's waste management system, requiring residents to schedule mattress pickup through Waste Management or certified private haulers. The city's high housing turnover rate, driven by tech industry job changes and international worker visa transitions, creates consistent demand for bulky item disposal services. Many newer apartment complexes serving Google and NASA employees have specific protocols for bulky item pickup, including designated staging areas and advance notice requirements to property management. Our service works directly with corporate housing providers and apartment managers throughout Mountain View to streamline the process for residents who may be unfamiliar with local waste disposal requirements."
