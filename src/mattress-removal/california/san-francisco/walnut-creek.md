localRegulations: "Walnut Creek operates under Contra Costa County waste management regulations with unique challenges created by its transit-oriented development and mature housing stock. The new Transit Village around BART stations requires coordination with underground parking systems and construction activities. Rossmoor's 55+ gated community (9,200 residents) has specific access protocols and waste management restrictions. Many apartment complexes built in the 1970s have narrow stairwells and limited elevator access requiring specialized handling. BART modernization projects create temporary access restrictions in the downtown core. The city's affluent professional population generates predictable furniture turnover during career relocations. Our service navigates these access and scheduling challenges while ensuring compliance with California's Mattress Stewardship Program and Contra Costa County environmental standards."
