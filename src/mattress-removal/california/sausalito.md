  heroDescription: "A Bedder World provides specialized mattress removal throughout Sausalito's unique waterfront community and luxury residential areas. From historic houseboats to hillside estates, we navigate strict Marin County regulations with next-day scheduling and eco-friendly disposal that serves this affluent coastal city."
  
  aboutService: "Sausalito's distinctive character as California's premier houseboat community creates unique mattress disposal challenges. The city's 7,269 residents live in a mix of historic floating homes and hillside properties that demand specialized service approaches. Historic floating homes in the Marinship District require specialized dock access and Richardson Bay regulatory compliance. Steep hillside properties present unique access challenges requiring careful navigation of narrow winding roads. The waterfront location and luxury property standards create service expectations that value professional, reliable coordination with marina offices and property management companies."
  
  serviceAreasIntro: "Sausalito's dramatic hillside geography and waterfront location create distinct access considerations across neighborhoods. Downtown Bridgeway offers direct access but requires coordination with ferry traffic and tourist congestion. The Marinship District's houseboat communities need specialized dock navigation and marina coordination. Alta Mira's steep hillside properties require careful maneuvering of narrow winding roads."

Marin Resource Recovery Center processes materials using state-of-the-art equipment, supporting the pristine environmental standards that define this affluent coastal community."
