  environmentalImpact: "Central Coast wine country values environmental stewardship, and proper mattress disposal supports Atascadero's commitment to preserving pristine landscapes. With wine tourism driving regional sustainability initiatives, each mattress we process diverts approximately 40 pounds of materials from San Luis Obispo County landfills through certified recycling facilities. Steel springs go to metal recycling, foam becomes carpet padding, and cotton becomes industrial textiles. This directly supports county waste diversion goals while protecting the natural beauty that defines California's Central Coast wine region."
