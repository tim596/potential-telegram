localRegulations: "Unlike Cumberland County's ecomaine system which requires residents to transport mattresses to the Gorham facility during limited hours and pay per-item disposal fees, our independent service eliminates transfer station trips entirely. Ecomaine's facility operates restricted weekday and Saturday hours that conflict with Portland's busy healthcare schedules, waterfront work shifts, and tourism industry demands."

These folks picked up my old hospital bed mattress on a Saturday morning while I was sleeping after my Friday night shift. Left clear instructions about the side entrance and they followed them perfectly. Professional team that understood healthcare worker schedules."
