    that works around tourism schedules and property management timelines.
  
  aboutService: >-
    Kissimmee's unique position as the gateway to Disney World creates distinct mattress removal challenges across 
    30,000+ vacation rental properties and established residential communities. Our service navigates high-turnover 
    vacation homes, seasonal demand spikes, and resort-style property requirements while managing Orlando metro logistics.

    including gated resort communities, multi-bedroom vacation properties, and property management coordination. Our team 
    understands Kissimmee's tourism-driven economy creates year-round disposal needs but limited city scheduling flexibility.

    limitations including volume restrictions and weekly scheduling constraints that complicate vacation rental operations.
  
  environmentalImpact: >-
    Kissimmee's tourism economy generates significant furniture turnover, but limited local recycling infrastructure 
    means most mattresses end up at JED Landfill in Saint Cloud. We partner with regional recycling networks to 
    divert materials when possible while ensuring responsible disposal for vacation rental properties.
    
    Our service supports Kissimmee's business community by handling disposal efficiently, allowing property managers 
    to focus on guest experiences rather than waste logistics. Professional removal helps maintain the quality 
    standards that make Kissimmee attractive to visitors and residents.

    turnover needs and tourism peak periods. We coordinate with property managers and work around guest check-in schedules.
