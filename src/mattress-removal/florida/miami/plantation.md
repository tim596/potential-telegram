    this award-winning planned city.
  
  aboutService: >-
    Plantation's distinction as one of South Florida's most successful master-planned communities creates unique 
    mattress removal challenges across diverse zones. Our service coordinates with the three main business districts - 
    Plantation Midtown, Gateway, and Technology Park - while managing residential communities with strict architectural 
    guidelines and HOA protocols established since the city's 1953 incorporation as "The Dream City."
    
    With nearly 98,000 residents across 55 diverse cultures in this planned community, we handle complex logistics 
    from corporate office relocations to multi-generational family transitions. Our service navigates planned community 
    zoning restrictions, scheduled bulk collection limitations (15 cubic yards maximum), and coordinate with Waste 
    Management's specific placement requirements while serving Plantation's unique business-residential integration model.

    responsibility across diverse cultural populations.

    planned community environmental goals. We partner with local recycling networks and process up to 75% of mattress 
    materials through regional partnerships, helping maintain the community character that has made Plantation a model 
    for successful planned development in South Florida's competitive market.
