localRegulations: "Wisconsin doesn't mandate a mattress recycling stewardship program, but Milwaukee County requires proper disposal through city drop-off centers or licensed private haulers. Mattresses cannot be placed in regular trash and must be transported by licensed waste haulers to approved recycling facilities. The city operates two drop-off centers that accept mattresses at no cost for single items, with fees applying for larger volumes. Private disposal requires coordination with Milwaukee County's waste management system and proper documentation for licensed facilities. Our professional service eliminates these compliance complexities - we maintain all required Wisconsin licensing, coordinate with certified recycling facilities, and handle proper documentation for Milwaukee County requirements. Choose our licensed service instead of navigating drop-off center schedules or finding approved disposal sites yourself."
