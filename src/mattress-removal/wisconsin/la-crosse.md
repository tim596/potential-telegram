  heroDescription: "Professional mattress removal serving La Crosse's river valley community. With over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide, we bring reliable service to Wisconsin's Mississippi River hub."
  aboutService: |
    <p>Getting rid of old mattresses in La Crosse means navigating county landfill fees, dealing with steep bluff access, or timing around the constant student housing turnover that defines this river city. We handle these challenges directly. Our service has recycled over 1 million mattresses through our nationwide network, bringing that expertise to your door whether you're in a downtown historic home, a bluffside property with river views, or a student apartment near UW-La Crosse.</p>

    <p>La Crosse residents call us during the major seasonal transitions - students moving out in May after graduation, families relocating when healthcare jobs change at Gundersen or Mayo, or homeowners upgrading after enduring another Wisconsin winter. We understand this Mississippi River community's rhythm, working around academic calendars, coordinating with healthcare shift schedules, and planning for the terrain challenges that come with living in river valley bluffs.</p>

    <p>Instead of loading mattresses into your vehicle for the trip to the county landfill or trying to navigate narrow downtown streets during Oktoberfest season, we come directly to you. Our team knows La Crosse's unique geography - from French Island bridge access to the steep grades leading up to Grandad Bluff overlooks - and handles proper disposal while you focus on what matters most in this vibrant college and healthcare community.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "We serve all of La Crosse metro, from Mississippi riverfront neighborhoods to bluffside communities, covering every ZIP code in Wisconsin's western river valley hub."
  regulationsCompliance: "La Crosse County's disposal system requires mattresses to be handled as large, bulky items with fees starting at $10 or $120 per ton at the county landfill facility. Regular dumpster disposal is banned with potential fines. We eliminate the trip to the county facility, the fee calculations, and the hassle of determining which disposal option fits your situation - just direct, professional pickup service."
  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>La Crosse sits at the heart of the Driftless Region where the Mississippi River creates unique ecosystems that residents work hard to protect. This environmental awareness extends to responsible disposal practices that keep materials out of the river valley watershed. Our recycling process separates steel springs, foam, and fabric components for reuse in manufacturing, preventing approximately 65 pounds of material per mattress from reaching regional landfills.</p>

    <p>About 85% of each mattress we collect gets diverted from Wisconsin waste streams and processed into new products through established recycling partnerships. Steel springs become new metal products, foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabric supports textile manufacturing - supporting the circular economy values that outdoor recreation communities like La Crosse naturally embrace.</p>

    <p>For environmentally conscious residents who appreciate La Crosse's position as a gateway to pristine river valley recreation, our service provides a practical way to handle mattress disposal responsibly. You know your old mattress is being processed through verified facilities rather than adding to landfill concerns in this treasured Mississippi River landscape.</p>
