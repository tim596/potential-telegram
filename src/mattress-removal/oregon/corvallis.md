localRegulations: "Mattress disposal in Corvallis operates through Republic Services at 541-754-0444 for bulk pickup scheduling with additional fees and limited service area availability, or direct transport to Coffin Butte Landfill at 28972 Coffin Butte Road during Monday-Saturday 8 AM to 5 PM hours. As Oregon State University's college town with 35,681 students creating constant housing turnover, mattress disposal faces unique challenges during semester transitions, lease endings, and graduation moves when rapid turnaround is essential but traditional methods cannot accommodate the timing demands."

  aboutService: "Next-day mattress pickup at $125 designed for Corvallis's unique position as Oregon State University's college town and Benton County's educational hub. From OSU students managing semester transitions and graduation moves to faculty navigating housing changes and residents throughout Highland Valley and Monroe Avenue districts, Corvallis's 60,408 residents plus 35,681 enrolled students face distinct disposal challenges in Oregon's premier university community. Rather than coordinating with Republic Services' bulk pickup availability limitations, managing service area restrictions, or making trips to Coffin Butte Landfill during limited Monday-Saturday hours, our streamlined service handles everything through one simple appointment. Whether you live near OSU's historic 420-acre campus, downtown Corvallis's walkable districts, or residential neighborhoods throughout ZIP codes 97330-97333, we understand the practical needs of a college town with constant rental housing turnover and academic calendar timing. Each collected mattress flows through our national recycling network that has processed over 1 million units, with 80% of materials recovered for manufacturing reuse - supporting the same innovation and sustainability values that make OSU a leader in research and education."
