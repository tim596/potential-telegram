localRegulations: "Medford garbage collection operates through Rogue Disposal & Recycling, which provides weekly residential trash service year-round throughout the city. Bulk item pickup is available for mattresses and large items, though scheduling and additional fees apply. Jackson County oversees solid waste franchise agreements for unincorporated areas, while Medford manages its own collection services. As Southern Oregon's largest city with 87,353 residents and Jackson County hub, Medford's waste management faces unique challenges from the region's 175 sunny days annually, agricultural activities, and position as the Rogue Valley's industrial and retail center serving both Southern Oregon and Northern California."
