      neighborhood: "University District"
    - text: "Exceptional service during our Victorian home's holiday tour preparation. We needed three bedrooms refreshed before guests arrived for the Candlelit Christmas event. The team collected our old mattresses promptly from the curb, allowing us to focus on decorating. Their reliability was crucial during such a busy time - downtown Hattiesburg was bustling with tour preparations, yet they arrived exactly when scheduled. Professional, courteous, and they clearly understand how important these community events are to our historic district. Would absolutely recommend to fellow Victorian homeowners preparing for any major hosting."

  heroDescription: "Curbside mattress pickup and eco-friendly disposal serving the Hub City's transportation crossroads. Next-day service for USM Golden Eagles, downtown residents, and families throughout Hattiesburg's historic neighborhoods."
  aboutService: "Need curbside mattress removal in the Hub City? Just get your mattress to the curb, and we handle the rest. Our next-day pickup serves every neighborhood from the USM Golden Eagles campus to downtown's revitalized arts district. As Hattiesburg's transportation crossroads at Interstate 59 and Highways 49, 98, and 11 shaped our logistics heritage, we bring that same efficiency to your mattress disposal. Whether you're a student transitioning between semesters, a downtown resident upgrading for HUBFEST hosting, or clearing out after the Victorian Candlelit Christmas home tour season, simply place your mattress curbside and we'll collect it promptly. Our team coordinates around the Hub City's unique rhythm - from USM Golden Eagles move-in periods to downtown Live at Five concert nights - ensuring pickup fits your schedule."
  serviceAreasIntro: "As the Hub City where major transportation routes converge, we efficiently serve every Hattiesburg neighborhood with curbside pickup. From The Avenues family-friendly streets to University District rental areas, from the revitalized downtown arts scene to historic Victorian neighborhoods - simply place your mattress curbside for collection:"
  regulationsCompliance: "As the Hub City grows with downtown loft conversions and new USM Golden Eagles housing, mattress disposal needs spike during key times. City bulk pickup through Action Line (601-545-4500) can't match the pace of student move-outs or the Victorian Candlelit Christmas home preparation rush. Republic Services bulk routes don't align with HUBFEST cleanup or semester transitions when the whole town's in motion. Our curbside service cuts through this complexity - no wrapping requirements, no waiting for city schedules, just reliable next-day pickup that works with Hattiesburg's event calendar and academic rhythm."
  environmentalImpact: "The Hub City's transportation heritage makes us natural leaders in efficient, sustainable logistics. While Mississippi lacks the state mattress recycling programs of California or Oregon, we partner with licensed facilities using our Interstate 59 access for optimal routing to regional processing centers. Steel springs from USM dorms and downtown loft conversions become construction materials, while foam supports southeastern manufacturing. This approach aligns with Southern Miss's sustainability initiatives and downtown Hattiesburg's green development goals. Our service provides documented proof of proper handling - essential for the growing number of rental properties serving USM students and downtown arts district residents."
  howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day appointments available throughout Hattiesburg. We coordinate around USM academic schedules and work within city requirements for residential and commercial areas."
  howItWorksService: "Licensed team collects your curbside mattress using professional equipment designed for Hub City efficiency. We navigate Hattiesburg's diverse neighborhoods with local expertise - from busy USM rental districts to quiet Avenues family streets to bustling downtown arts areas."
  howItWorksDisposal: "Your mattress goes to certified recycling facilities supporting Mississippi's environmental initiatives and Hattiesburg's community sustainability goals."
