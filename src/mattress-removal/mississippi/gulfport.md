localRegulations: "Harrison County requires proper disposal of mattresses through licensed waste management services, with the City of Gulfport providing municipal waste collection that may have specific bulk item pickup requirements and advance scheduling needs for large items like mattresses. While we also offer convenient curbside removal, our professional service provides superior flexibility with same-day and next-day availability, door-to-door pickup from any location within your property, and elimination of advance scheduling requirements. We maintain all required Harrison County and Mississippi waste hauler licenses and work directly with certified facilities, providing disposal documentation that satisfies both residential lease requirements and military housing standards. Unlike municipal pickup which may have limited availability during hurricane season and storm recovery periods, our service accommodates the demanding schedules of military families during PCS moves, the constant turnover in coastal rental properties, and the urgent cleanup needs that arise from Gulf Coast weather events."
