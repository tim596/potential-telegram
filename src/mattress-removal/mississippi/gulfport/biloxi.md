    - text: "After Hurricane Katrina, we rebuilt our French Quarter home and needed fresh bedding throughout. These folks handled removal from three bedrooms during our renovation. Professional team understood the narrow historic street access and worked around our contractor schedule. Their service made our post-storm rebuild process much easier."

  heroDescription: "Curbside mattress pickup serving Biloxi's casino district, French Quarter, and coastal neighborhoods. Next-day Gulf Coast service for gaming industry workers, historic district residents, and military families."
  aboutService: "Need curbside mattress removal in the Seafood Capital? Place your mattress curbside and we handle the rest. Our Gulf Coast service covers every Biloxi neighborhood from the bustling Casino Row waterfront to quiet East Biloxi residential streets. As the gaming industry transformed Biloxi post-Hurricane Katrina with $2.5 billion in annual casino revenue, housing turnover accelerated across French colonial cottages, casino district condos, and military housing near Keesler AFB. Whether you're a casino shift worker upgrading apartments, a French Quarter resident restoring historic property, or military family during PCS season, simply place your mattress curbside for reliable pickup. Our team navigates Biloxi's unique coastal challenges - from hurricane season logistics to casino district parking constraints - ensuring smooth collection."
  serviceAreasIntro: "From Biloxi Bay's historic waterfront to North Biloxi residential areas, our curbside service reaches every coastal neighborhood in the Seafood Capital:"
  regulationsCompliance: "Biloxi's dual waste system creates disposal complexity. Harrison County Utility Authority assigns residential garbage to Waste Management and bulk items to Pelican Waste, but casino district workers and military families need flexible timing that municipal schedules can't match. Seafood festival crowds, Mardi Gras celebrations, and hurricane season evacuations disrupt regular collection routes. Our curbside service eliminates this uncertainty with guaranteed next-day pickup, transparent pricing, and reliable scheduling that works around Biloxi's casino economy and coastal lifestyle."
  environmentalImpact: "With Mississippi lacking the Bye Bye Mattress stewardship program found in other coastal states, responsible disposal becomes crucial for Biloxi's environmental recovery. Our Gulf Coast partnerships route materials to certified processing facilities, recovering steel springs for regional construction and foam for coastal restoration projects. This approach supports the seafood industry's environmental needs and Biloxi's post-Katrina rebuilding sustainability goals. We provide documented disposal records essential for casino resorts, military housing, and French Quarter historic properties requiring environmental compliance."
  howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day appointments throughout Biloxi's coastal zones. We coordinate around casino shift schedules, military deployment timelines, and seasonal tourism patterns."
  howItWorksService: "Licensed team provides curbside collection using Gulf Coast-equipped vehicles designed for coastal access, casino district navigation, and hurricane-resistant logistics."
  howItWorksDisposal: "Your mattress goes to certified Gulf Coast recycling facilities supporting Mississippi's coastal environmental initiatives and Biloxi's post-Katrina sustainability commitments."
