  heroDescription: >-
    Professional mattress removal service throughout Nampa's growing communities. 
    Next-day curbside pickup with licensed team handling disposal and recycling. 
    Serving new subdivisions, established neighborhoods, and all Canyon County areas in Idaho's second-largest city.

  aboutService: >-
    Our licensed mattress removal team provides curbside pickup throughout Nampa's diverse neighborhoods, from 
    historic downtown areas to rapidly expanding North and South Nampa subdivisions like West Highlands and Cedar Springs. 
    We handle every type of mattress - memory foam, innerspring, hybrid, latex - along with box springs and bed frames.
    
    Nampa's role as Canyon County seat and Idaho's second-largest city creates specific removal challenges, from 
    agricultural-residential transitions to new subdivision developments and college housing near Northwest Nazarene University. 
    We manage the entire removal process with same-day scheduling and next-day pickup, working within Canyon County 
    Solid Waste systems and Republic Services coordination so residents don't navigate disposal complexities.

  serviceAreasIntro: >-
    We provide curbside mattress removal throughout Nampa's 12+ neighborhoods, from established Central areas 
    to rapidly growing North and South developments. Our service covers new subdivision construction requiring 
    builder coordination, college housing transitions, and agricultural-area properties across all ZIP codes 83651-83687.

  regulationsCompliance: >-
    Our service coordinates directly with Canyon County Solid Waste at Pickles Butte Landfill and Republic Services 
    for proper bulk disposal management. We handle all regulatory requirements for licensed hauling while 
    working with Idaho DEQ standards and Canyon County transportation regulations for securing loads. 
    Since Idaho lacks state mattress stewardship programs, we prioritize recycling through certified facilities, 
    successfully recycling over 75% of collected mattresses.

  environmentalImpact: >-
    Nampa's agricultural heritage and family-oriented community values demand responsible disposal practices 
    that support both environmental quality and suburban development growth. We partner with local recycling 
    facilities and donation networks to divert materials from Canyon County landfills, successfully recycling 
    over 75% of collected mattresses through certified Idaho partners.
    
    Our environmental approach serves Nampa families by handling eco-conscious disposal for new subdivision 
    moves, college student transitions, and home upgrades in established neighborhoods. Metal springs go to 
    scrap recycling, foam becomes carpet padding, and fabric becomes industrial materials, with only 
    non-recyclable items going to licensed county disposal facilities.

  howItWorksScheduling: >-
    Schedule curbside pickup online in under 60 seconds or call (720) 263-6094 for same-day booking. Next-day 
    pickup available throughout all Nampa neighborhoods with scheduling coordinated around new construction, 
    agricultural area access, and Canyon County logistics.

  howItWorksService: >-
    Our professional crew arrives for curbside pickup at your scheduled time. We handle the heavy lifting to get 
    mattresses from your home to the curb for removal. Our team navigates Nampa's mix of suburban subdivision 
    requirements, rural-residential access, and college area logistics efficiently.

  howItWorksDisposal: >-
    After pickup, we transport your mattress to appropriate recycling facilities or donation centers. Over 75% 
    of mattresses are recycled or donated, with only non-recyclable materials going to licensed disposal facilities. 
    You get peace of mind knowing your old mattress was handled responsibly and in compliance with all county regulations.
