      text: "We live in one of the historic Victorian mansions in Clifton Park, which has been our family's home for three generations. When we needed to update the guest bedroom with new furniture, this mattress removal service made the process incredibly smooth. They understood the historic nature of our neighborhood and were careful navigating our circular driveway and dealing with our 1890s home's narrow doorways. The crew arrived Saturday morning as scheduled, professionally removed our antique bed frame's old mattress and box spring, and completed everything in about twenty minutes. The $165 total was much more convenient than trying to coordinate with the county's bulk pickup system ourselves, especially considering our busy schedules with work in downtown Cleveland and kids' activities at Beck Center for the Arts."
