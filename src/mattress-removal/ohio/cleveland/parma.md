As Ohio's largest suburb, residents can access bulk waste pickup through Cleveland area waste systems requiring mattresses be wrapped in plastic when placed curbside. Ridge Road Transfer Station accepts mattresses free of charge up to 4 times per year with 4 cubic yard limits per visit. Parma's substantial population of 81,146 creates high demand for efficient waste disposal alternatives to county facility coordination."

      text: "We live near Veterans Memorial Park where our kids play soccer every weekend through the Parma Recreation Department leagues. When we upgraded our guest bedroom furniture last month, this mattress removal service made everything incredibly convenient. They scheduled the pickup for Saturday morning before our son's game, arrived exactly on time, and professionally removed our queen mattress and box spring without disturbing our pre-game routine. The crew understood that families in Parma value punctuality and efficiency, especially on busy sports weekends. The $165 total was completely worth avoiding the hassle of wrapping everything in plastic and coordinating with Cuyahoga County's bulk pickup system ourselves, particularly since we were already juggling kids' activities and our work schedules downtown."
