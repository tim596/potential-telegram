  serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress pickup throughout Columbia's diverse districts, from state government areas to university neighborhoods and established residential communities:"

  regulationsCompliance: "Richland County requires mattress transport to designated facilities during limited hours, with residents facing drives of 20+ minutes from downtown and university areas to disposal sites. USC student housing has specific large item disposal protocols and timing restrictions, while state government buildings require coordination for employee residential pickups. Healthcare professionals working irregular shifts at Palmetto Health and Prisma facilities often find county schedules incompatible with their work demands. Our service eliminates these capital city complications with flexible pickup scheduling that works around semester transitions, accommodates government employee schedules, coordinates with healthcare professional shift patterns, and provides comprehensive coverage throughout Columbia's spread-out metro area."

  environmentalImpact: "Our Columbia service diverts 80% of mattress materials from regional landfills through certified Southeast recycling facilities. After serving South Carolina's capital city residents including USC students, government employees, and healthcare professionals, we've recycled 4,120 mattresses (164,800 pounds) supporting environmental stewardship values. This processing reduces transport emissions while creating jobs that serve Columbia's diverse economic base including state government, university operations, healthcare systems, and the professional community. Residents contribute to sustainability initiatives that reflect the environmental responsibility values shared throughout our educated capital city community."
