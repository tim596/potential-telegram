  aboutService: "Our North Charleston service delivers next-day pickup with specialized expertise from over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide. We excel at the unique coordination challenges of serving aerospace workers at the Boeing plant, military families navigating PCS moves, and residents across our spread-out suburban geography.

  regulationsCompliance: "Charleston County requires residents to transport mattresses to convenience centers during limited weekday hours, with locations often 15-20 minutes away from suburban neighborhoods. Military families face additional base housing coordination requirements, while shift workers find county schedules conflict with plant timing. Our service eliminates these complications with flexible pickup scheduling, base protocol coordination, and comprehensive neighborhood coverage throughout our spread-out community."

  environmentalImpact: "Our North Charleston service diverts 80% of mattress materials from regional landfills through certified Southeast recycling facilities. After serving our community's aerospace workers, military families, and suburban residents, we've recycled 2,380 mattresses (95,200 pounds) supporting environmental stewardship values. This regional processing reduces transport emissions while creating jobs that serve our diverse economic base including aerospace manufacturing and military operations. Residents contribute to sustainability initiatives that reflect the environmental responsibility values shared throughout our community."
