# Local regulations content
localRegulations: "Wilmington operates under Delaware Solid Waste Authority (DSWA) regulations requiring special pickup scheduling for mattresses through Wilmington 311 services. Items exceeding 50 pounds or unable to fit in standard trash cans require advance coordination with city collection services. The Delaware Solid Waste Authority provides additional disposal resources through their hotline 1-800-404-7080 and coordinates household hazardous waste collections. Professional pickup services must comply with city ordinances for residential collection timing and vehicle access in dense urban neighborhoods. Delaware Green Mattress Disassembling & Recycling operates in-state processing facilities recovering steel, wood, and foam components from collected materials."

      text: "Work in the financial district downtown, needed quick mattress pickup from my Market Street apartment. Team scheduled around my banking hours and handled narrow hallway access perfectly. Removed queen mattress from third floor walk-up with zero damage. Professional service worth $125 - much easier than coordinating city special pickup."
