### _Overview: Mattress Disposal In Phoenix_

Although phoenix and the entire state of Arizona is on the forefront of many eco-friendly initiatives and practices, it is still very difficult to find a place to get rid of your old mattress. Phoenix does not have a widespread active recycling program and the majority of their donation centers do not accept mattresses of any kind. While it can be tough to get rid of a mattress, we have put together a list of the options that you have when it comes to mattress disposal Phoenix and the surrounding areas.

If your mattress is in decent condition, it is very probable that someone may want to use it. Believe it or not there are actually a lot of people who benefit greatly from saving a buck and purchasing a used mattress. PRO TIP: Make sure to take nice pictures and highlight the fact that your mattress DOES NOT have any stains and DOES NOT have bed bugs. This will put potential buyers minds at ease and increase the chances that someone will take it off your hands for you.

## Option #5: DIY Mattress Recycling Project

![](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-768x429.png)

If you are a DIY and like taking on projects why not recycle your mattress yourself. This could be a great way to teach your kids about being resourceful or just a fun way to save some money and the environment. By recycling your mattress you can save on average 26sq.ft. of landfill space. We have a great step-by-step blog post on [how to break down and recycle your own mattress.](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/) Along with another post on [how to recycle your box spring yourself](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-box-spring/). To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for the foam.
