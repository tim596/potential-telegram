![how-to-get-rid-of-a-mattress-in-cincinnati-banner-image](/filtered-images/Most-Attractive-Youtube-Thumbnail-2023-03-20T192605.520-1024x576.png)

If you live in the Cincinnati area and need to get rid of an old mattress, then you have come to the right place. In this article we cover 5 local mattress disposal options that residents can take advantage of when getting rid of an old bed.

Mattresses have become harder and harder to get rid of over recent years due to their inability to effectively break down in landfills as well as their sanitary concerns. Many landfills and donation centers throughout Ohio no longer accept mattresses or charge additional fees for their disposal. Luckily, services have popped up that help with this problem. From a statewide curbside mattress recycling service to specific drop off and donation centers, we have included something for everyone.

If you have a mattress that is in good condition and free from rips, tears or stains, you may want to consider donating it. The vast majority of donation centers in Cincinnati do not accept mattresses, but New Life Furniture bank does! They have a program called "Beds for Sleepyheads" where they help to make sure kids have beds to sleep in across the city. This is a great cause and a great opportunity to get more use out of your mattress if it still has it. Below is some info on the things that they accept and do not accept.

## Option #3: Drop at the [Rumpke Sanitary Landfill](https://www.rumpke.com/about-us/locations/ohio/cincinnati/landfill) of Cincinnati

![rumpke-logo](/filtered-images/logo-2018.png)

We always recommend recycling or donating a mattress whenever possible. Mattresses are hard to compress in landfills and take up a lot of unnecessary space. BUT sometimes there isn't another option. If you have a means to transport your mattress then taking it to the Rumpke landfill in Cincinnati is another option. They do accept mattresses here.

#### What We Accept at the Rumpke Sanitary Landfill:

●       Municipal solid waste (garbage, waste materials)

●       Construction debris (drywall, brick, concrete)

●       Wood waste (pallets, scrap lumber)

●       Demolition debris

●       Mattresses

●       Furniture and appliances

#### **Address:** 

##### 3800 Struble Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45251

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Cincinnati's Craigslist](https://cincinnati.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in decent shape you may want to consider giving it away or selling it online. There is a large market of people looking to get a lightly used mattress for a discount rather than spending hundreds to thousands on a new one. If you are willing to go the craigslist or facebook route you can almost certainly get rid of a mattress as long as it doesn't have any sanitary concerns or major issues.

For a successful sale be sure to take nice pictures and ensure potential buyers that it does not have any stains and is bed big free. Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![man-tearing-open-an-old-mattress](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-1024x572.webp)

If you want to save some money and do the environment a favor you can opt to recycle your mattress yourself. This is a small project that includes the physical tearing apart of the mattress followed by the recycling of each material inside (metal and foam). We have a full article [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

To start you will want to tear off the cover and separate the metal and foam materials inside.

You can take the metal to a local scrap metal yard (like [3r-recycling-cincinnati.com/scrap-metal](https://www.3r-recycling-cincinnati.com/scrap-metal)) where they will likely even give you some cash for it. They will then melt it down and recycle it.

You can take the foam to a local business like a carpet manufacturer where they will use it to make carpet padding. Check craigslist for people looking for used foam and call around and you will be able to find someone who will take it off your hands.
