Finally, the cost can become quite high if you send the mattress to another continent altogether.

Of course, the weight and size of the mattress also play into it.

Heavier products will generally cost more to ship than lighter ones.

Deciding how far your mattress needs to go is critical in estimating your ultimate shipping cost.

## The Best Way To Protect a Mattress During Shipping Packing a mattress for shipping can be challenging because of its size and weight.

## How Long Does It Take To Ship a Mattress?

Shipping a mattress can be surprisingly pricey, with much of the cost dependent on delivery speed.

You'll likely pay way more if you go for a faster delivery option, like one-day options that don't factor in the distance.

Fortunately, if you're not in any extreme rush to get your mattress and can wait several days, longer delivery times offer an economical alternative that won't break the bank.

## Is Shipping a Mattress Really Worth It?

Shipping a mattress is a decision that comes down to the mattress's value and the shipping cost.

It makes sense if it's a new mattress; the new shipping will only be an extra $400.

Generally, [replacing an old mattress](https://www.techradar.com/news/how-often-should-you-change-your-mattress) should happen every 5-9 years anyway, so if yours hit that mark, don't worry about shipping—buy new.

Remove your blankets, comforter, sheets, pillows, and even stuffed animals, if any are on or under your bed.

As for disassembling it, you must gather up all the parts and secure them into one bag with a label about what each piece is for before losing some screws or nails during relocation.

Also, if you have never disassembled a bed frame, then take notes on how each part fits into one another so that it will be easier when it's time to reassemble your bed again.

### Consider the Size of the Mattress An essential part of shipping a mattress is knowing the exact size, dimensions, and weight.

The best way to measure the size of your mattress is with a measuring tape.

If it's too complicated, take a look at printed documents or contact the manufacturer, who will provide you with all the information you need promptly and efficiently.

Before sending off your precious cargo, double-check its measurements to ensure everything arrives in one piece.

In addition to tracking down all the needed details, you should research suitable shipping methods, such as bubble wrap protection formulated specifically for mattresses.

It's important to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each option so that you end up with an efficient and cost-effective service that suits your needs.

## Getting Your Mattress Ready for Shipment When shipping a mattress, preparations are wrapping and boxing the components of your bed set.

Encasing your mattress and box spring with heavy-duty shrink wrap, packing foam, and bubble wrap is highly recommended for an added layer of protection during travel.

You can zip your mattress into its encasement or plastic wrap for extra shielding.

To make sure each component of your bed set arrives safely, you'll want to secure the box frames and box springs together with packing tape – this will help minimize damage in transit.

If you're on a tight budget, you may wonder whether shipping or buying a new mattress is better.

The first thing to consider is the residual value of your old mattress.

That is, how much can you get for it?

If shipping costs are relatively high, buying instead of shipping would be more economical.

You should also add the cost of both options and compare the total with the new mattress price.

Regardless of your decision, measure each option's financial impact so you can make an informed decision that serves your financial objectives.
