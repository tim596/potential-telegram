 First and foremost, make sure you're dealing with bed bugs.

Look for tiny, flat, reddish-brown insects, their eggs, or dark fecal spots on your pillows, sheets, and mattress.

Bed bugs tend to hide during the day and become active at night, so you might want to use a flashlight to spot them in the seams or folds of your bedding.

## 2\.

Remove the infested pillows: Carefully remove the infested pillows from your bed, trying not to disturb the bed bugs and cause them to scatter.

Place the pillows in a large plastic bag, seal it tightly, and remove it from your bedroom.

## 3\.

Treat the pillows: Unfortunately, most pillows cannot be saved from a bed bug infestation due to their porous nature.

It is usually best to discard infested pillows in a sealed plastic bag and replace them with new ones.

However, if you absolutely must salvage the pillows, consider these options: - Heat treatment: Place the sealed pillows in a dryer on high heat for at least 30 minutes.

The heat should kill all stages of bed bugs, including eggs.

- Professional treatment: Contact a pest control professional to discuss treatment options for your pillows.

They may be able to use specialized equipment and techniques to eliminate the bed bugs.

## 4\.

Clean the surrounding area: After dealing with the infested pillows, it's essential to clean and treat the surrounding area to eliminate any remaining bed bugs: - Strip your bed: Remove all bedding, including sheets, blankets, and pillowcases, and wash them in hot water followed by a high heat dryer cycle.

- Vacuum the mattress, box spring, and bed frame: Use a [vacuum cleaner](/blog/mattress-vacuums/) with a hose attachment to clean all areas where bed bugs may be hiding.

Don't forget to vacuum the seams and folds of your mattress, as well as the edges of your box spring and bed frame.

Dispose of the vacuum bag or contents in a sealed plastic bag immediately after use.

- Consider using mattress and box spring [encasements](https://www.mypmp.net/2016/09/19/bed-bugs-do-mattress-encasements-help/): Encasements can help trap any remaining bed bugs inside and prevent them from infesting other areas of your home.

Make sure to choose encasements specifically designed for bed bug protection.

## 5\.

Monitor for bed bugs: After completing the above steps, monitor your bedroom for any signs of bed bug activity.

Use bed bug interceptors on your bed legs to help detect any remaining or returning bed bugs.

If you continue to find evidence of bed bugs, it's time to call in a [professional pest control expert](https://www.epa.gov/bedbugs/hiring-pest-management-professional-bed-bugs) to ensure the infestation is thoroughly eradicated.
