 ## Step #2: Posting/Selling Online ## (8 Tips) * * * 

### 1\.

Clean and sanitize the mattress:

 

![vacuuming-futon-mattress](/images/blog/Add-a-heading-68-1024x819.png)

 Before listing your mattress for sale, make sure it's clean and free of any stains or odors.

Vacuum it thoroughly, spot clean any stains, deodorize, and, if possible, steam clean it. A clean mattress will be more appealing to potential buyers. 

### 2\.

Take high-quality photos:

 

![vibe-mattress-on-bed-frame](/images/blog/71ywBF1vEL._SL1600_-768x1024.jpg)

 Take clear, well-lit photos of your mattress from different angles, including close-ups of any important features or labels.

Make sure the images accurately represent the condition of the mattress.

Good photos will help your listing stand out and attract potential buyers. 

### 3\.

Write a detailed and honest description:

 In your listing, provide an accurate and informative description of the mattress, including the brand, model, size, age, and condition.

Mention any specific features or benefits, such as firmness level, materials used, or if it's a specialty mattress (e.g., memory foam, latex, or hybrid).

Be honest about any signs of wear or damage. 

### 4\.

Set a fair price:

 

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-1024x838.png)

 Research the market to determine a competitive price for your used mattress.

Factors to consider include the mattress's brand, age, condition, and demand for the specific type of mattress.

Be open to negotiation, as buyers often expect to haggle on the price. 

### 5\.

Choose the right platform:

 

![craigslist-logo-mattress-disposal](/images/blog/635925127643002128-a-copy-1024x579.jpg)

 Both Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace are popular options for selling used items.

Consider listing your mattress on both platforms to increase visibility and reach more potential buyers.

Be sure to follow each platform's guidelines and rules for selling used mattresses. 

### 6\.

Follow safety precautions when meeting potential buyers:

 Arrange to meet potential buyers in a public, with people around, or have someone with you when they come to view the mattress.

Use caution when sharing personal information, and communicate through the platform's messaging system whenever possible. 

### 7\.

Offer delivery options (if possible):

 If you have the means to transport the mattress, consider offering delivery options for an additional fee.

This can make your listing more appealing to buyers who may not have the means to transport the mattress themselves. 

### 8\.

Be patient and responsive Selling a used mattress can take time.

Be patient and respond promptly to inquiries from potential buyers.

Good communication can help build trust and increase the likelihood of a successful sale.

By following these tips, you can increase your chances of successfully selling your used mattress online through platforms like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace.

 ### 2\.

Try A Local Donation Center 

![local-mattress-donation](/images/blog/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

 Many people think of [Salvation Army](/blog/does-salvation-army-take-mattresses/), [Goodwill](/blog/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options/) and [Habitat for Humanity](https:

//www.habitat.org/) as the primary options when donating a mattress or box spring.

However, many of these organizations no longer accept mattresses due to bed bug and sanitary concerns.

But luckily there are often many local donation centers that accept mattress donations and put them to good use.

Any donation center will provide a receipt for tax purposes and will often pick up the mattress for free.

The mattresses are then given to those in need or resold to raise money for various programs.

Another great option is local shelters.

Many local shelters accept mattress donations and put them to good use.

The mattresses are often given to people who need them or are sold in their thrift stores to raise money for the shelter.

Hospitals often accept mattress donations as well.

The mattresses are used for patients in need and are often replaced after being used for some time.

[Several organizations](https://charity.lovetoknow.com/charitable-donation-resources/best-mattress-donation-options-which-ones-pick-up) specialize in mattress donations.

These organizations often accept gently used mattresses and either give them to those in need or resell them.

Several of those organizations include: - Vietnam Veterans of America - St.

Vincent de Paul Society - Furniture Bank - Pick Up Please - Purple Heart - ReStore - Sleep in Heavenly Peace While people enjoy the ease of dropping off donations at places like Salvation Army, there's no need to give up if your local store doesn't take mattress donations or you don't have an easy option.

Local Trash Service OR Landfill 

![landfill-las-vegas](/images/blog/WE_WastePile.jpeg)

 Trashing your mattress is not the best way to rid yourself of an old mattress, but it is the only option available for some people.

If you have exhausted all your mattress removal options, then [trashing it](https:

//www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-information/mattress-disposal-guide) may be the best course for you.

But before you dump it on the curb in front of your residence, you should call the city.

Many cities and towns offer mattress disposal programs.

Check with your local municipality to see if mattress recycling programs are available.

These programs often require you to pay a small fee, but it can be worth it if you want to keep your mattress out of the landfill.

You can also locate your town or municipality recycling center.

These are generally large facilities near the local landfill where you can get rid of your used mattress and finally dispose of that pizza box that's been sitting in your kitchen for a week.

Of course, you'll have to have a [car big enough to transport the mattress](/blog/7-best-car-air-mattresses-buyer-guide/), but at least it's one way to dispose of it responsibly.

If you want to avoid hassle with the details of disposing of your used mattress, you can always hire a junk removal service.

Most services offer free estimates and will take care of the entire process.

That process includes coming to your home with a truck, having several employees carry it out of your home, and taking it to a recycling center or other facility designed to break down the material.

You can also rent a [dumpster](/blog/get-rid-of-a-mattress-by-throwing-it-in-the-dumpster/) if you handle the disposal process yourself.

This option is great if you're working on a larger project and need to dump other things like debris from a home renovation or excess yard debris.
