## How Firm Are Marriot Mattresses?

For hotels, having the right mattress firmness can make or break a guest's experience.

The firmness level of hotel Marriot mattresses is typically medium-firm due to their universal feel.

Most bodies and sleeping positions enjoy this firmness, making it an easy choice for hotels to provide quality comfort and support.

Yet, should the guest call for a different level of firmness, many hotels are more than willing to oblige and offer specific beds tailored to those needs.

Thanks to their sturdy construction and durability levels, medium-firm mattresses can hold up against this daily use for longer periods- providing great rest during every visit.

## Can You Experience the Comfort of a Marriot Mattress in Your Home?

While you can purchase mattresses from many manufacturers, why not bring your hotel sleeping experience to the comfort of your bedroom with a hotel mattress?

Many well-known hospitality brands, such as Hampton Inn, Hilton, and [Holiday Inn](/blog/what-mattress-does-holiday-inn-use/), rely on mattresses from two main manufacturers.

Marriot creates the popular Marriot Bed, which homeowners can browse for comparison and authenticity.

Whether you purchase directly from a hotel or go with a manufacturer's similar version, plenty of options are available depending on what works best for your budget.

## Find Out How Frequently Marriot Replaces Their Mattresses Many hotels, from economy to hotel chains such as Marriot, replace their mattresses every three to five years.

Additionally, hospitality standards require high-quality construction and the best materials to withstand years of wear and tear.

Sanitation is also a main concern for hotels; many use antibacterial covers for extra protection and as an additional measure for keeping bedding clean for each guest.

Marriot Hotels are dedicated to providing comfortable sleeping experiences in safe environments, and frequently replacing mattresses is one way they work to meet customer expectations continuously.

## Do Hotels Dispose of Their Used Mattresses?

Purchasing used mattresses from hotels can be tricky as it can vary widely depending on the particular situation of a hotel.

Individuals looking to buy these secondhand mattresses may need to check which furniture liquidators or wholesalers the hotel works with and contact them directly.

Another option you could go for might be inquiring if the hotel would [donate their mattresses](/blog/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options/) to organizations that'd be more than happy to accept them.

It is worth looking into both options and then deciding what suits your needs best.

## What Are the Typical Sizes of Hotel Beds?

Hotel bed sizes come in two standard sizes.

King-size beds, typically 76 x 80, are usually used in single-occupancy hotel rooms.

Full-size mattresses, generally measuring 54 x 75, are most commonly found in double-occupancy hotel rooms.

However, sometimes a slightly smaller king size of 72 x 84 is used to help provide more space in the room.

Occasionally hotels also provide queen-sized mattresses which measure 60 x 80.

No matter the size, it's guaranteed that you will get a good rest when staying at a quality hotel.

## Can Long Can a Mattress Last?

When it comes to mattresses, many of us are guilty of taking them for granted.

We expect that they'll serve us without fail until a certain point when they're ready to be replaced.

However, did you know that the life expectancy of a mattress can vary greatly? A [mattress can last](/blog/make-your-mattress-last-longer/) anywhere from seven years up to 20, depending on the wear and tear and its components.

Memory foam and latex mattresses are renowned for lasting much longer than your traditional innerspring model, with 14-20 years being their upper limit.

Although the chances are low, purchasing high-quality mattresses may be worthwhile for those wanting more bang for their buck.

## How Does Marriott Make Their Mattresses?

All of their beds feature what's known as a coil-on-coil construction.

This design combines two types of coils to provide the mattress with support and comfort.

The first layer consists of an extra thick pocketed spring design that helps maintain the bed's shape while providing pressure relief.

On top of this is another layer of thinner comfy coils that add more contouring, making sleepers feel more comfortable and offering cooling benefits more than traditional [innerspring](/blog/full-size-innerspring-mattress/) or foam material used by other mattress makers. A key point to note is Marriott uses high-quality steel in these inner layers rather than low-quality steel found in cheaper brands, ensuring guests have a great night's rest at one of their hotels.

## Wrap Up Marriott hotels proudly reveal that they use custom-made mattresses crafted in partnership with Simmons Bedding Company.

These beds have been designed with multiple layers of cushioning and support, allowing Marriott's guests to sleep peacefully amidst the comfort of their plush mattresses.

The design itself has taken more than two years to perfect.

It comprises [individually wrapped coils](/blog/best-pocketed-coil-mattress/) and an ultra-comfort top layer tailored specifically to give an extra level of comfort.
