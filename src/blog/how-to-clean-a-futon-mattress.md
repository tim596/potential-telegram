 Vacuum the Mattress ![vacuuming-futon-mattress](/images/blog/Add-a-heading-68-1024x819.png)

To begin cleaning your futon mattress, you’ll need to remove it from the frame.

Then, get a [vacuum cleaner](https://www.tsbvi.edu/independent-living-library/skills/vacuum-cleaner) with a brush attachment.

Use the [vacuum](/blog/mattress-vacuums/) cleaner to remove debris from the top of the mattress, and gently move the brush attachment over the entire surface.

Ensure to get into all crevices and corners.

You may use a hand brush to eliminate dust buildup if there are any inaccessible corners.

Once you finish vacuuming one side, rotate the mattress to work on the other side.

### Step 2:

 Use Baking Soda To Remove Odor From Your Mattress ![sprinkle-baking-soda-on-futon](/images/blog/Add-a-heading-69-1024x819.png)

Your futon mattress will likely develop a musty odor if you don’t give it proper care.

To deodorize your mattress, sprinkle a significant amount of [baking soda](https://news.ncsu.edu/2014/05/baking-soda-powder/) on its surface and let it sit for at least an hour.

Afterward, vacuum the mattress once more to get rid of the baking soda.

If necessary, repeat this process a few more times until you achieve a pleasant smell.

### Step 3:

 Using a Mild Detergent, Remove Stains From Your Mattress ![futon-cleaning-detergent](/images/blog/Add-a-heading-70-1024x819.png)

In most cases, the best course of action is to clean up spills as soon as they occur.

If you’re quick enough to clean up a spill, you might be able to remove most of it before it penetrates deep into the surface.

If you have persistent stains, it’s best to use a mild detergent to get rid of them.

First, make a cleaning solution by mixing mild detergent with warm water.

Then, dip a sponge into the solution and gently scrub any visible stains on the mattress.

Focus on areas with heavy staining, but be careful not to scrub too hard, as this could damage the fabric.

Rinse off the solution with a clean, damp towel and allow the mattress to air dry.

Before using the detergent directly on the stain, you should ascertain that it will not cause any harm or discoloration to the mattress by performing a spot test on a tiny section of the fabric.

Avoid using too much water because it might make your futon damp and prone to [mold](/blog/mold-on-a-mattress/) and mildew.

You’re free to utilize a stain-removing pen if the stains are minor.

You should consider employing a different method if the stains are stubborn.

That entails mixing equal vinegar and water and then applying the solution to the impacted region.

After covering the stain with baking soda, use [hydrogen peroxide](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hydrogen-peroxide/default.html) and dishwashing soap.

Let the mixture sit for some minutes, and wipe it off with a paper towel.

Afterward, allow your mattress to dry in the sun for a whole day.

Nevertheless, the mattress will take less time to dry if it’s clear and sunny outdoors.

Once your mattress is fully dry, vacuum it to eliminate any remaining baking soda.

It’s also a good idea to check your futon’s mattress label for any instructions from the manufacturer.

Some mattresses may have special cleaning requirements.

### Step 4:

 Clean the Futon Frame Your futon’s frame is just as important as the mattress, requiring cleaning to prevent mold and dust accumulation.

After taking the futon off its frame, give it a good wipe-down with a damp washcloth.

If it is a metal frame, ensure you use a cleaner specifically made for metal furniture.

Regular dusting solutions can result in metal frame [corrosion](https://www.electrochem.org/corrosion-science/), so avoid using them.

## How To Remove Urine From a Futon Mattress ![remove-urine-from-a-futon-mattress](/images/blog/Add-a-heading-71-1024x819.png)

It’s possible that vacuuming and spot cleaning won’t be enough to remove certain kinds of stains, such as urine.

The likelihood of seeing urine spots on your mattress is more common if you have young children or pets.

Urine accidents are also common among the elderly and those with [incontinence conditions](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/urology/adult-patients/urinary-incontinence.aspx).

Luckily, there are different techniques to remove the stains and cover up the scent, whether damp or dry.

Here are the steps to remove urine stains on your futon mattress.

### Step 1:

 Blot up the Area With a Clean Cloth or Paper Towel Start by blotting up as much urine as possible.

Work from the outside of the stain, as this will help to avoid spreading it further.

### Step 2:

 Apply Vinegar to the Stain Apply some [vinegar](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/vinegar/) to the sore spot.

Consider using a spray bottle to make work easier.

Vinegar has a pungent odor, but it fades away with time.

After applying the solution to the stain, wait approximately five minutes.

You may also consider using an enzymatic cleaner in vinegar’s place.

The products break down the proteins in pet and human urine, making them easier to remove.

They’re available in most pet stores or online.

### Step 3:

 Blot up the Excess Dampness It would be best to blot the area again with a clean cloth or paper towel to remove the cleaner and any remaining urine.

### Step 4:

 Add Baking Soda Once More To help prevent odors, sprinkle baking soda over the affected area.

### Step 5:

 Allow the Mattress Some Time To Dry After cleaning, your mattress will need at least a day to dry.

If you must leave it inside, you can speed up the drying process by opening the windows and turning on the fan.

If you prefer leaving your mattress outside, it’s best to do it on a day when the sun is out and the temperature is high.

Once the mattress is dry, you may remove the baking soda and vacuum it like a regular mattress.

If the stain has had time to dry, removing it will be more difficult, and you will have to employ a more powerful solution.

## Follow the steps below if your urine stains are already dry.

### Step 1:

 Make a Hydrogen Peroxide Solution Using a mixing container, combine three teaspoons of baking soda, two drops of dish soap, and three tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide.

### Step 2:

 Apply the Solution to the Spot Apply the mixture with a washcloth to the stain.

Drying out will take less time if you soak the futon too thoroughly.

### Step 3:

 Saturate the Stain With Laundry Powder Combine three teaspoons of laundry powder with one tablespoon of water.

Apply the paste all over the futon’s impacted area and let it rest for thirty minutes.

### Step 4:

 Remove the Paste From the Futon To remove any excess powder or paste from the mattress, vacuum over its whole surface.

## How To Remove Blood From a Futon Mattress ![how-to-get-blood-out-of-a-futon](/images/blog/Add-a-heading-72-1024x819.png)

Accidents can happen, and sometimes a futon mattress may end up with blood stains.

Here are the steps to follow when removing blood stains from your futon mattress.

### Step 1:

 Blot up the Area Start by blotting the area with a damp cloth or sponge.

Don’t rub, as this may cause the stain to set in deeper.

### Step 2:

 Create a Hydrogen Peroxide Solution If the blood is still visible after blotting, mix dish soap and hydrogen peroxide in equal measures and apply the resulting solution directly to the stain.

Let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes, then blot again.

For tougher stains, it may be necessary to use a stain remover such as: - Enzyme-based cleaner - Color remover 

### Step 3:

 Remove the Soapy Residue Once the stain has gone away, rinse the area with cold water to remove any soapy residue and allow the futon mattress to air dry.
