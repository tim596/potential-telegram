In this article, we'll explore the history of [mattress tags](https://americanlawlabel.com/product/mattress-fabric-law-labels/), the laws surrounding them, and why they play an important role in [consumer protection.](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2006-03-15/pdf/06-2206.pdf#page=28)

## The history of mattress tags ![old-mattress_tag](/images/blog/mattress_tag.jpeg)

The origin of mattress tags can be traced back to the early 20th century.

During this time, mattresses were often filled with unsanitary and even dangerous materials, such as used rags, horsehair, or corn husks.

To make matters worse, some unscrupulous manufacturers would recycle old, soiled mattresses and sell them as new products, posing severe health risks to consumers.

In response to these unsanitary practices and growing public concern, the government stepped in to regulate mattress manufacturing.

In the 1920s and 1930s, several states in the United States began to introduce [laws](https://sleepproducts.org/advocacy/federal-mattress-regulations/) requiring mattress manufacturers to disclose the materials used in their products.

These regulations aimed to protect consumers from purchasing unsafe and unsanitary mattresses and served as the foundation for the modern mattress tag system.

## Can You Remove a Mattress Tag? QUICK ANSWER: Yes, as the end consumer, you are allowed to remove the mattress tag from your mattress once it is in your possession.

The warning "Do not remove under penalty of law" applies to manufacturers, retailers, and distributors, not the end consumer.

However, it's essential to keep in mind that removing the tag may void the warranty or make it more difficult to return or exchange the mattress, so it's best to check the manufacturer's warranty and return policy before removing the tag.

## The different types of mattress tags ![different-types-of-mattress-tags](/images/blog/images-1.jpg)

There are different types of mattress tags that vary based on the information they contain and the regulations governing them.

Here, we will explore some of the most common types of mattress tags.

### Material Content Tags These tags disclose the materials used in a mattress, including the type of foam, innerspring, or other components.

They also list the percentages of each material used, which is crucial for consumers who may have allergies or sensitivities to specific materials.

Material content tags are required by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act.

### Manufacturer Information Tags These tags provide information about the mattress manufacturer, including their name, address, and manufacturing date.

This information allows consumers to trace the origin of their mattress and helps regulators ensure that manufacturers are adhering to safety and labeling standards.

### New or Used Tags In many states, mattress tags must indicate whether a mattress is new or used.

This requirement protects consumers from unknowingly purchasing a used or refurbished mattress, which may have been exposed to allergens, pests, or other contaminants.

If a mattress has been sanitized and meets specific requirements, it may be labeled as "used" or "previously owned."

### Flammability Tags Mattress flammability tags indicate that the product meets federal flammability standards, as regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

The CPSC enforces the 16 CFR Part 1633 standard, which requires mattresses to pass stringent flammability tests.

These tags provide assurance to consumers that their mattress has been tested for fire safety and meets the necessary requirements.

### Care and Maintenance Tags Some mattress tags include care and maintenance instructions, such as how to clean the mattress or rotate it for even wear.

While not legally required, these tags can provide valuable information to help consumers extend the life of their mattress and maintain its comfort and support.

### Warranty Information Tags Warranty information tags provide details about the manufacturer's warranty on the mattress, such as the length of coverage and what defects are covered.

While not always directly on the mattress tag, this information is often included with the product's packaging or documentation.

## The Laws Surrounding Mattress Tags Today, mattress tags are regulated by both federal and state laws in the United States.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, which requires manufacturers to list the materials used in their mattresses accurately.

The FTC also mandates that the tags display information about the manufacturer, such as their name and location.

In addition to federal regulations, [individual states have their own laws](/blog/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide/) governing mattress tags.

For instance, many states require manufacturers to include a statement indicating whether the mattress is new or used.

Some states also mandate the use of specific language, such as "Do not remove under penalty of law," to ensure that the tags remain intact.

## Why Mattress Tags Matter While mattress tags may seem like a minor detail, they play a crucial role in protecting consumers.

By disclosing the materials used in a mattress, these tags help buyers make informed decisions about their purchases.

For those with allergies or sensitivities, knowing what's inside a mattress can be critical to their health and well-being.

Moreover, mattress tags help to enforce sanitary standards in the mattress industry.

By requiring manufacturers to disclose whether a mattress is new or used, these tags ensure that consumers are not unwittingly purchasing a recycled or unsanitary product.

Finally, mattress tags serve as a tool for regulators to monitor the industry and hold manufacturers accountable.

By checking tags during inspections, regulators can ensure that manufacturers are complying with safety and labeling standards, helping to maintain a safe and transparent marketplace for consumers.
