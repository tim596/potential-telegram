If your mattress is in good condition you can try dropping it at a local donation center. Mattresses are [expensive](https://www.abedderworld.com/most-expensive-mattresses.html/) and there are many people who could benefit from having a high quality mattresses donated. Note that many [donation centers have strict policies about taking mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) and will only take them if they are in great condition. We recommend calling first.

We reached out to [Goodwill](https://goodwillsouthtexas.com/) and [Arms of Hope](https://donatethisrecyclethat.com/) and due to sanitary concerns neither of these donation centers are accepting mattresses at this time.

A few times a year, the city of Corpus Christi organizes heavy brush and bulky items collections. During these authorized periods, you can have a mattress taken away - but there are some downsides to this option. 

- Only happens 2x per year.

- Your mattress won’t be recycled. Instead it will head to take up space in the landfill. 

- Thirdly, there are a some rules that come with leaving out bulky items for pickup. If you make a mistake (such as not separating your bulky items from your heavy brush) you incur a fee. 

To find out when your next bulky item authorized period is, check out this [link](https://www.cctexas.com/solid-waste/heavy-brush-bulky-items) and find your area from the service map.

If you are up for a fun project, why not grab the family and teach them how to be green and resourceful. You can tear your mattress apart and separate the foam and springs. Then take the springs to the scrap metal center and the foam to a carpet manufacturer where they can use it to make carpet padding. They may even pay you for it! Here is a post on [how to recycle a mattress yourself](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

If your mattress is in decent shape there are lots of people who would prefer to buy it or take it off your hands rather than spending hundreds or thousands for a new one.
