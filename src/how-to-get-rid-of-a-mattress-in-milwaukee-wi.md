## **2. [City of Milwaukee Bulky Item Pick Up](https://city.milwaukee.gov/mpw/divisions/operations/environmental/sanitation/Bulky-Item-Pickup#.Wy7qz5M-cWo "Links active once published")**

In order for trash to be accepted in Milwaukee as regular trash pickup on your regular pick-up day, up to 1 cubic yard of bulky items are allowed. According to the City of Milwaukee a queen size mattress or larger is TOO LARGE and must be recycled/disposed of another way. See below for specifics on bulky item pickup guidelines and restrictions in Milwaukee. ​![mattress-pick-up-milwaukee](/filtered-images/screen-shot-2018-06-23-at-6-51-32-pm.png)

## **3\. Drop-off at a [Milwaukee Landfill](https://city.milwaukee.gov/mpw/divisions/operations/environmental/sanitation/DropOff#.Wy7x0pM-cWq "Links active once published")** 

In Milwaukee there are two landfill locations to drop mattresses/boxsprings:  
\- [North](https://www.google.com/maps/place/6660+N+Industrial+Rd,+Milwaukee,+WI+53223/@43.1390862,-87.9972311,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88051d4057a7fe31:0xd311e368e111efef!8m2!3d43.1390862!4d-87.9950424 "Links active once published") - 6660 N Industrial Road  
\- [South](https://www.google.com/maps/place/3879+W+Lincoln+Ave,+Milwaukee,+WI+53215/@43.0022733,-87.9649005,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88051a77f68af9e3:0x79c538b6e308311a!8m2!3d43.0022733!4d-87.9627118 "Links active once published") - 3879 W Lincoln Avenue  
This disposal option works well if you have a truck or another large vehicle to transport your unwanted mattress and/or boxsprings. The downside being that mattresses dropped off at either of the above locations are obviously put into the Milwaukee landfill system. If possible, recycling your mattress is always a better and more environmentally friendly option than dumping at a landfill, as mattresses are tough to break down and take up a great deal of space.

## **4\. DIY Mattress Recycling** 

With the limited mattress disposal resources in Milwaukee sometimes it is best to get creative and take matters into your own hands. If your feeling ambitious, DIY mattress recycling can have a tremendous impact on environment preservation and conservation. Budget Dumpster has a great step-by-step blog ​post on how to break down and recycle your own mattress. To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for the foam.
