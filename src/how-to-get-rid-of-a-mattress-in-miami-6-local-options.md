If you live in Miami, Figuring out what to do with your old mattress can be a difficult process. Many donation centers and landfills are no longer accepting mattresses due to sanitary concerns and their inability to compress and breakdown.

Thankfully Miami has some other great mattress disposal options available to residents. Whether you want a mattress recycling company to come to your home and pick it up or you want to drop it off somewhere, we have included a variety of options.

## Option #2: Miami Mattress Donation

![local-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

UPDATE: The majority of donation centers we contacted no longer accept the vast majority of mattresses. The mattresses they do take must be in GREAT condition. Their policies are [constantly changing](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) depending on needs so we recommend calling before dropping off.

You could always donate your mattress to someone who can use it and get the rest of its life out of it. There are lot of people who can benefit from getting a mattress donated rather than buying a new one for hundreds or thousands of dollars.

Some local donation centers include

- [Miami Rescue Mission](http://www.miamirescuemission.com/thrift-store.php)

- [Goodwill of South Florida](https://goodwillsouthflorida.org/donation-centers)

- [Salvation Army](https://satruck.org/)

You’ll need to ensure that the mattress is still in usable condition, being somewhat new, isn’t soiled, damaged and that there are no bed bugs.

Mattress donations often go to shelters or are sold on to raise funds for their cause. It’s worth noting that not _all_ charities accept mattress donations due to health and safety concerns.

You’ll need to call the organization to see what their donation regulations are before committing.

## Option #3: [Miami-Dade Bulky Waste Pick Up](https://www.miamidade.gov/global/service.page?Mduid_service=ser148069212998189)

### Mattress Pick Up Guidelines:

- Must be fully encased in a plastic mattress bag or sleeve and sealed with weather-resistant tape, such as packing tape or duct tape. The box spring does not have to be encased.

- Cannot weigh more than 150 lbs

- Only 2 pick ups per address per calendar year

- No more than 25 cubic yards

- Violations may result in a $100 fine.

A couple times a year Miami's bulky waste service will pick up bulky items, included in your trash fees.

You will be required to set up an appointment with the [Bulky Appointment System](https://www.miamidade.gov/global/service.page?Mduid_service=ser148069212998189).

Then all that’s left to do is pop your old mattress on the curb of your address for a maximum of three days prior to your appointment.

Make sure you follow the guidelines to avoid any automatic fees being tacked on to your trash bill.

## Option #4: Take It To [North Dade or South Dade Landfills](https://www.miamidade.gov/global/service.page?Mduid_service=ser1464799833678390)

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress first. If that isn't an option, you can always take an unwanted mattress straight to the local landfill yourself. (although check current policies because many dumps are no longer accepting mattresses)

IMPORTANT NORE: _Anyone disposing of anything at a landfill must wear a reflective safety vest at all times. Hard hats, safety glasses and closed-toed/steel-toed shoes or boots are strongly recommended_

## Option #5: Sell it On [Miami's Craigslist](https://miami.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is still in good condition and still has some life left in it, you can always opt to sell it to someone who needs one.

There is a big market for used mattresses with a lot of people looking to get a deal on a lightly used one rather than spending hundred or thousands on a new one.

Craigslist and Facebook marketplace are great places to list your mattress for either free or up to a few hundred dollars depending on its age and quality.

Be sure to take nice clean photos and ensure buyers that it doesn't have a stains or bed bugs. Happy selling!

## Option #6: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![inside-lux-midnight-mattress](/filtered-images/IMG_3264-768x1024.jpeg)

If you have a little extra spare time on your hands and want to be resourceful you could always deconstruct your mattress yourself.

Simply cut off the cover and separate the metal and foam inside. The metal springs can be dropped at a scrap metal yard where they will give you cash for it.

The foam can be taken to a carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. Be sure to call first as not all carpet manufacturers accept used foam.

Whichever option you choose, you can be sure that you’ll have that unwanted mattress off your hands.
