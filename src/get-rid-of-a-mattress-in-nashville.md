![local-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

IMPORTANT: Many donation centers have become VERY strict about the mattresses that they do accept. Your mattress must be in extremely good condition and almost new to be considered. We recommend calling first to make sure they will accept your donation.

Here are some donation center options to consider donating a mattress to in Nashville:

1. [Goodwill Industries of Middle Tennessee](https://giveit2goodwill.org/) - Goodwill Industries of Middle Tennessee is a nonprofit organization that accepts donations of clothing, household items, and furniture. They have several donation centers located throughout the Nashville area, and some [may accept mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/). To find a donation center near you, visit their website at giveit2goodwill.org.

3. [The Salvation Army](https://www.salvationarmynashville.org/) - The Salvation Army is a nonprofit organization that accepts donations of clothing, household items, and furniture. They have several donation centers located throughout the Nashville area, and some may accept mattresses. To find a donation center near you, visit their website

5. [Habitat for Humanity ReStore](https://www.habitatnashville.org/habitat-humanity-restore) - Habitat for Humanity ReStore is a nonprofit organization that accepts donations of furniture, appliances, and building materials. They have several locations throughout the Nashville area, and some may accept mattresses. To find a ReStore location near you, visit their website.

Before donating your mattress, it is important to check with the organization to make sure they will accept your mattress and to find out any specific guidelines or requirements for donations. In addition, it is recommended to donate only mattresses that are in good condition, as organizations may not accept mattresses that are stained or damaged.

## Option #4: Sell Or Giveaway on [Craigslist](https://nashville.craigslist.org/) or Facebook Marketplace

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in usable condition you will almost certainly be able to find someone to take it off your hands on craigslist or facebook. New mattresses are expensive and there are a lot of people looking to save a buck on a lightly used one.

Be sure to take nice clean photos and ensure potential buyers that there are no stains and no bed bugs. Also, we always recommend to meet someone at a public place and be smart and safe when using any of these apps to sell to an unknown person. Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![inside-look-at-the-birch-mattress-layers](/filtered-images/IMG_4263-768x1024.jpeg)

If you want to take on a small project you can always recycle your mattress yourself. To do this you will cut off the cover and separate the foam and metal springs inside.

You can take the metal to a local scrap metal yard in Nashville like [Franklin Metals](https://www.franklinmetals.com/nashville-scrap-metal-recycling/) where they will weigh it and give you cash based on the total weight. The metal then gets melted down and recycled.

You can cut up the foam and put it in a bag and bring it to a local carpet manufacturer, where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. Be sure to call first, as not all carpet manufacturers accept foam from the public.

We hope that these services and options give you a way to get rid of your mattress that works for your specific situation and budget. Nashville has a lot of great options for mattress disposal if you know the right places to look.

If none of those options work you can always call your local Nashville trash service and order a [bulky item pick up](https://sheriff.nashville.gov/bulk-item-removal/) but note that your items will likely end up in the landfill.
