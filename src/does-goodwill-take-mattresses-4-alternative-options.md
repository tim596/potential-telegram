# Does Goodwill Take Old Mattresses? (Plus 4 Alternative Options)

Does Goodwill take mattresses? What are their policies Let's find out...

![does-goodwill-take-mattresses-banner](/filtered-images/Most-Attractive-Youtube-Thumbnail-83-1024x576.png)

As you begin to try to get rid of an old mattress you may find it's near impossible. When getting rid of unused items, many people think of places like Goodwill or Habitat for Humanity. After all, many of those places take just about everything off your hands in the name of helping others. 

BUT you may want to think twice about taking your mattress to Goodwill.

A mattress is a different type of item than a gently used toy or a shirt you haven’t worn in 10 years. Years of sweat, dirt, grime, and the potential scare of Bed Bugs make it difficult to get rid of a mattress, much less donate it. Companies like Goodwill have become more and more weary of taking items like mattresses.

## Goodwill and Mattresses: What You Need To Know

**THE QUICK SUMMARY:**  
  
Most of Goodwill's policies on mattresses differ from state to state or city to city. However, most Goodwill stores DO NOT allow mattresses to be donated due cleanliness and bed bug fear.  
  
Some Goodwill locations do accept mattresses. The mattresses must be less than 5 years old, free of rips or stains and not have any bed bugs. The mattress also must be cleaned and delivered in a mattress bag.  
  
Wondering if your local Goodwill accepts mattresses? Give them a call or check out their location specific website.

Most of Goodwill's policies on mattresses differ from state to state or city to city. However, most Goodwill stores DO NOT allow mattresses to be donated because of a myriad of highly understandable reasons. 

For one thing, used mattresses have been used by someone else, so you may need to check if it was ever cleaned or if there are any lingering bacteria or pests. We'll place some heavy emphasis on the pests part here. 

Bed bugs are a natural thing to be taken very seriously. Even [pest control professionals](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/pest-control/facts-about-bedbugs/) believe bed bugs to be the most challenging insect to treat and remove from a house. A bed bug infestation affects as many as 1 in 5 households. Goodwill doesn't want any of their items to be the next breeding ground for bed bugs. 

Mattress quality matters as well. For example, mattresses to be donated may have been used for a long time and may be worn out or lumpy. Have you ever slept on a lumpy mattress before? We wouldn’t suggest it. 

Your mattress type is crucial, too. Water beds are not going to be accepted. Old coil spring mattresses also run the risk of breaking. Any custom or odd size mattress like an [olympic queen](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-olympic-queen-mattresses.html/), [3/4](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-three-quarter-mattresses-to-buy-online.html/), [full xl](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-full-xl-mattresses.html/) or [narrow twin](https://www.abedderworld.com/cot-mattress.html/) mattress will likely not be accepted. Although you may have luck with [rv mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/rv-replacement-mattress.html/) as many people are looking for replacements but can't find them.

Also, if the mattress is old, it may contain hazardous materials like polybrominated diphenyl ethers or polyurethane foam, which can off-gas over time and may be dangerous to your health. You don't want anyone else to breathe this stuff. 

Finally, used mattresses may not be as comfortable as brand-new ones, leaving anyone with the chance of a bed far past giving a restful night's sleep.

Still, a handful of Goodwill stores allow [mattress donations](https://casper.com/blog/how-to-donate-a-mattress/), but with some caveats. First, they must be in good condition. A "good condition" mattress means the mattress must be free of any stains, rips, or tears and not have any signs of bedbugs or other pests. Goodwill also requires that all mattresses be in a sealed plastic bag to protect their staff and other customers.

If you have any questions about your local Goodwill and if they take used mattresses, contact them for more information. If you cannot donate a mattress, the employees there may have a fantastic suggestion on where the mattress can go. Of course, this leads us to our next point.

## 2\. Try Another Local Donation Center

![local-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

Many people think of Goodwill and Habitat for Humanity as the primary options when donating a mattress or [box spring](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-get-rid-of-a-box-spring.html/). However, several other organizations accept mattress donations and put them to good use. 

[The Salvation Army](https://satruck.org/donate/choose) is an excellent option for mattress donations. They can provide a receipt for tax purposes and will often pick up the mattress for free. The mattresses are then given to those in need or resold to raise money for various programs.

Another great option is local shelters. Many local shelters accept mattress donations and put them to good use. The mattresses are often given to people who need them or are sold in their thrift stores to raise money for the shelter.

Hospitals often accept mattress donations as well. The mattresses are used for patients in need and are often replaced after being used for some time. 

[Several organizations](https://charity.lovetoknow.com/charitable-donation-resources/best-mattress-donation-options-which-ones-pick-up) specialize in mattress donations. These organizations often accept gently used mattresses and either give them to those in need or resell them. Several of those organizations include:

- Vietnam Veterans of America

- St. Vincent de Paul Society

- Furniture Bank

- Pick Up Please

- Purple Heart

- ReStore

- Sleep in Heavenly Peace

While people enjoy the ease of dropping off donations at places like Goodwill, there's no need to give up if your local store doesn't take mattress donations or you don't have an easy option. 

Quick, let's go to the Internet!

## 3\. Sell or Giveaway Online

Luckily, social media has made getting rid of things we no longer need even easier than loading the stuff into a car and dropping it off at a donation center. 

Your favorite social media platforms, such as Facebook and Nextdoor, offer neighborhood pages where users can post anything—even free stuff!

Simply searching on these platforms can help you locate "for free" groups in your area that allow users to post about stuff they are trying to donate. These postings are usually free and allow users to notify a large group of people who may require a mattress. All you need to do is post about your mattress, and you have a significant chance to get rid of an old mattress in only a few hours.

But the best part of this method is that others seeking a free mattress will come and take it off your hands without you lifting a finger. After all, a mattress can be a heavy item, and your lower back is less spry these days. 

There is also one final option if you still need to develop a method to get rid of your mattress.

## 4\. Local Trash Service OR Landfill

![landfill-las-vegas](/filtered-images/WE_WastePile.jpeg)

Trashing your mattress is not the best way to rid yourself of an old mattress, but it is likely the only option available for many people. Sometimes a donation center is in another town, or Facebook groups in their area need to be more populated. 

If you have exhausted all your mattress removal options, then [trashing it](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-information/mattress-disposal-guide) is the best course for you. 

But before you dump it on the curb in front of your residence, you should call the city. Many cities and towns offer mattress recycling programs. Check with your local municipality to see if mattress recycling programs are available. These programs often require you to pay a small fee, but it can be worth it if you want to keep your mattress out of the landfill.

You can also locate your town or municipality recycling center. These are generally large facilities near the local landfill where you can get rid of your used mattress and finally dispose of that pizza box that's been sitting in your kitchen for a week. Of course, you'll have to have a [car big enough to transport the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/7-best-car-air-mattresses-buyer-guide.html/), but at least it's one way to dispose of it responsibly.  

If you want to avoid hassle with the details of disposing of your used mattress, you can always hire a junk removal service. Most services offer free estimates and will take care of the entire process. That process includes coming to your home with a truck, having several employees carry it out of your home, and taking it to a recycling center or other facility designed to break down the material.

You also have the option of hiring a [mattress removal service](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-much-does-mattress-removal-cost-price-of-5-popular-services.html/). These companies collect and responsibly dispose of mattresses, often recycling parts of the mattress and donating any remaining materials to charities or organizations. Using a mattress removal service, you can dispose of your mattress correctly without creating additional waste.

Mattress removal services will typically collect your mattress from your home, often for a flat fee or a fee based on the size and [weight of your mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-much-does-a-mattress-weigh.html/). Some companies may even offer additional services such as mattress cleaning or sanitizing. Depending on the company, you can arrange for same-day or next-day pickup.

Once the mattress is collected, the removal service will typically take it to a local recycling or donation center. Here, the mattress will be broken down into parts, such as foam, wood, and fabric, and recycled or donated. This process ensures that the materials from your mattress are reused instead of going to a landfill.

You can rent a [dumpster](https://www.abedderworld.com/get-rid-of-a-mattress-by-throwing-it-in-the-dumpster.html/) if you handle the disposal process yourself. This option is great if you're working on a larger project and need to dump other things like debris from a home renovation or excess yard debris. 

## Conclusion

Getting rid of your mattress doesn't have to end with a trip to Goodwill. Unfortunately, many Goodwill stores do not accept mattress donations. While that might be frustrating for many, a phone call or a Google search usually yields a service, charity, or recycling center that will gladly take a mattress off your hands.
