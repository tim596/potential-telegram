![habitat-for-humanity-logo-mattress-disposal](/filtered-images/habitat-for-humanity-logo-1024x1024.jpg)

Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit organization that has been providing homes and housing facilities for people who are facing obstacles and troubles in their life that make it hard for them to have a place they call home. 

Be sure to call before donating mattresses because there are a lot of regulations when it comes to donating used mattresses. If your mattress is less than 5 years old, still has the tags on it, no rips or tears and no bed bugs then you may be able to have Habitat for Humanity accept it as a donation.

When you go onto their website, you will be able to arrange a scheduled pick-up date and time with ReStore who will come to take it off your hands.

_Just be sure to contact them before donating a mattress as they may not need mattresses at that time or may not accept your specific mattress._

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How Can You Tell When You Need A New Mattress?**

First, you’re going to want to check around the outside of the mattress and see if you can notice the [tag](https://www.abedderworld.com/mattress-tags.html/) as this can tell you how old the mattress is. 

If your bed springs make a loud squeak or have sagging [body impressions](https://www.abedderworld.com/a-sagging-mattresses-vs-mattress-body-impressions.html/), this also signifies that the mattress has reached the end of its lifespan and isn’t going to be as comfortable or supportive as it once was. 

The biggest and most reliable way to tell if a mattress is still going to be of much use is from your own experience sleeping on it, and if you notice any back pains or aches when you wake up in the morning.

If you do, this means it has a compromised support system and is probably worth getting rid of.
