![local-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

If you have a mattress that you would like to donate in Charlotte, there are a few local organizations that [may accept them](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/). Here are some options to consider:

IMPORTANT: You mattress must be in nice condition and lightly used to be donated. These donation centers will NOT accept mattresses that are older, have stains or rips or are not structurally sound.

1. [Beds for Kids](https://bedsforkids.org/) - Beds for Kids is a nonprofit organization that provides beds and other essential furniture to children and families in need. They accept new and gently used mattresses, as well as other bedroom furniture. Donations can be dropped off at their warehouse at 2519 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC 28203, or you can schedule a pickup by calling (704) 296-2633.

3. [Crisis Assistance Ministry](https://crisisassistance.org/donate/donate-furniture-appliances/) - They will accept lightly used or new mattresses. These items will be distributed to Mecklenburg County households facing financial hardship.  Items are provided free-of-charge and are distributed via Crisis Assistance Ministry's Partner Agency network. 

Before donating your mattress, it is important to check with the organization to make sure they still accept mattresses and need them at that time. In addition, only donate mattresses that are in good condition, as organizations will not accept mattresses that are stained or damaged.

## Option #3: Drop Your Mattress at a [Local Landfill/Transfer Station](https://www.mecknc.gov/LUESA/SolidWaste/Disposal-Recycling/Pages/Full-Service-Centers.aspx)

![frisco-landfill](/filtered-images/wade-parkaerial1-copy_750xx1381-777-0-81.jpeg)

It is not recommended to take a mattress to a landfill in Charlotte, North Carolina, as mattresses take up a lot of space and do not decompose easily. Instead, it is recommended to recycle the mattress if possible or donate it to a local charity. If neither of these options is available, you can drop your mattress at one of these 4 disposal drop-off locations around Charlotte.

If your mattress is in usable condition and you think someone could get some more life out of it you can list it on one of the local marketplaces and likely have it taken off your hands pretty quickly. A lot of people are looking to get a deal on a mattress rather than spend hundreds or thousands on a new one.

Just be sure to take nice pictures and emphasize the cleanliness of your mattress to put their mind at ease. Who knows they may even [pay you some cash for your mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/).

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

Recycling a mattress yourself and getting rid of the materials in Charlotte, North Carolina, is not an easy task, but it is possible with the right tools and knowledge of where to take them. Here are some steps on how to recycle a mattress yourself and how to dispose of the foam and metal inside:

1. Disassemble the Mattress - The first step is to disassemble the mattress. Use a sharp utility knife or scissors to cut through the fabric and remove the outer layer of the mattress. Once you have removed the outer layer, you will be able to access the foam and metal springs inside.

3. Remove the Foam - To remove the foam, use the utility knife or scissors to cut the foam into small pieces. You can then put the foam pieces in a large garbage bag or container to transport. If the foam is in good condition, you can take it to a carpet manufacturer for recycling into carpet padding.

5. Remove the Metal Springs - To remove the metal springs, use pliers or a wire cutter to cut the springs into smaller pieces. You can then collect the metal pieces in a container for transporting to a recycler. Many scrap metal recycling centers in Charlotte accept metal springs and will pay you for the metal.

7. Dispose of the Remaining Materials - After you have removed the foam and metal, you will be left with the fabric covering and any other materials that were used in the construction of the mattress. These materials can be disposed of in your regular garbage or used for DIY projects.

_It's important to note that recycling a mattress yourself can be a time-consuming and difficult process, especially if you don't have the right tools or experience. If you're unable or unwilling to recycle a mattress yourself, you may want to consider hiring a professional mattress recycling service or contacting a local recycling center to see if they accept mattresses for recycling._
