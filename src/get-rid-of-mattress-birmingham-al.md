## 4. [List Your Mattress on Bham Craigslist](https://bham.craigslist.org/ "Links active once published")

Believe it or not people do buy used mattresses on the Birmingham craigslist page. New mattresses are generally around $1,000 and seem to only get more and more expensive, therefore, many people opt to try to find a mattresses in a lightly used condition for a quarter of the price. In order to [sell your mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/) successfully on craigslist here are a few guidelines to follow:

**Highlight these in your post:**  
**A)** **No stains**\- Mattresses with stains are usually a deal breaker. If your mattress does not have stains make sure to highlight that in your post.  
**B) Make, Model & Year- Explaining what [mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/) you are selling and how old it is may seem like an obvious point, but believe it or not many craigslist sellers neglect to put this info in their post. Specific information about the product allows the customer to research the mattress for sale and understand the deal you are offering.  
**C)** **Price low to sell** - This is craigslist and that means people want deals. Generally speaking if your mattress is in good condition price it at 20% of the original buying price and you should get a quick sale.  
OR IF YOU JUST WANT IT GONE.....  
Price it for free and put it on the porch. If it is in decent condition it will be taken off your hands.**
