## Option #2: Donate to [BedStart](https://bedstart.org/schedule-a-pickup)

![bed-start-garland-tx-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/BedStart_NEW-1.jpeg)

_MUST BE GENTLY USED TO BE ACCEPTED._

**GENTLY USED DEFINITION**:

- No Stains

- No Rips

- No Tears

- No Cracking

- No Peeling

- FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND STURDY

If your mattress is in good condition, you can help a family out by donating it. Donating your mattress is a way to support the local community.

Before donating a mattress, check it over closely for damage and marks. Mattresses can’t be donated if they can’t be used, so this step saves everyone time and effort.

Look for any stains and rips, and make sure the mattress is still comfortable to sleep on.

Bedstart accepts mattresses but not all donation centers accept them due to a risk of bed bugs and sanitary issues. Before making the donation, contact your chosen service to see if they are currently accepting mattresses.

Be aware that even if they initially accept the mattress over the phone/online, they might refuse a mattress with obvious damage.

## Option #3: Frisco [Bulk Trash Pickup Service](https://www.friscotexas.gov/1350/Bulk-Trash-Pickup)

![frisco-logo](/filtered-images/Document.png)

IMPORTANT: This service can be used only to dispose of smaller mattresses. Must be _less than 6 feet, and weighing under 50 pounds_.

If you’re unable to recycle your mattress, Frisco does offer a trash pickup service for items that are too big to fit in the trash can.

To use the Bulk Trash Pickup Service, you need to schedule a collection day. This can be done over the phone, or via an online form.

You can contact the City of Frisco Bulky Waste Pickup at 972-292-5900. The online form can be found [here](https://www.friscotexas.gov/1350/Bulk-Trash-Pickup#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20have%20your,the%20day%20prior%20to%20service.). If you have a metal bed frame to recycle, contact Metal Recycling Pickup [here](https://www.friscotexas.gov/FormCenter/Environmental-Services-13/Metal-Recycling-PickUp-76).

If you’re moving house, or clearing a house, Frisco also offers a [Rent-a-Bin](https://www.friscotexas.gov/464/Rent-a-Bin) service. This is a 6 cubic yard bin, and is suitable for disposal up to 1 ½ tons. The Rent-a-Bin service is available for 3 days, with additional charges for extra days.

## Option #4: Drop at a [Frisco Landfill or Transfer Station](https://www.friscotexas.gov/478/Do-It-Yourself-Trash-Disposal)

![frisco-landfill](/filtered-images/wade-parkaerial1-copy_750xx1381-777-0-81.jpeg)

If you are unable to recycle, reuse, or donate your mattress, you may consider using a landfill. We recommend looking into other options first, as mattresses take up a lot of room in our nation's landfills.

Many landfills are changing their rules and no longer accept mattresses, due to the difficulty compressing them.

Before taking your mattress to a landfill, contact the transfer station to find out if they still accept mattresses. You may need to bring proof of residence, and pay a fee.

## Option #5: Giveaway (Or Sell) Using [Craigslist](https://dallas.craigslist.org/?postal=75034&search_distance=28) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

One of the best ways to get rid of an old mattress without damaging the environment is to sell or donate it online. Facebook Marketplace and [Dallas/Fort Worth Craigslist](https://dallas.craigslist.org/) are both good options for connecting with buyer’s in your area.

There’s a good chance you’re getting rid of your old mattress because you’re getting a new one.

So, you should understand just [how expensive a new mattress](_wp_link_placeholder) can be. This means there is a healthy resale market for mattresses that are in good condition.

Before selling your mattress online, check for marks and stains. Photograph the mattress on the bed, so that it looks appealing!

If you’re struggling to sell that mattress, you might want to consider offering it for free, to anyone willing to pick it up.

## Option #6: [Do It Yourself Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![diy-mattress-recycling](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2020-06-18-at-1.38.30-PM.png)

It can be hard to get rid of a mattress because they’re heavy and bulky items. If you chose not to use a mattress collection service, you might want to have a go at getting rid of the mattress yourself. 

If you have the time and space, you can recycle a mattress at home. You can find some tips on how to break down the mattress, and separating out the different areas, [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/). At this point, you need to find recycling centers in the area that accept each component.

Metal mattress springs can be taken to [Scrap Metal Buyers](https://www.scrapmetalbuyers.com/texas/251-frisco-tx), or other scrap metal services. They will offer you money for the old metal, so it’s worth the trip.

The foam is a little harder to get rid of, but if you look and call around you will be able to find places that take scrap foam — look for carpet manufacturers (they use it to make carpet padding).

## Final Thoughts

Mattresses are big and bulky items, so they’re rarely as easy to get rid of as other items of household waste. Instead of taking them to the recycling center, you have to get creative when disposing of your old mattress.

A service such as A Bedder World can remove your mattress, and ensure it doesn’t end up in a landfill.

If the mattress is still in good condition, you might consider donating it, or selling it through Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. Know any other methods for getting rid of a mattress in Frisco? Drop us a comment and let us know!
