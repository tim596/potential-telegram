## Option #2: Donate Your Mattress At [Dallas Furniture Bank](https://www.dallasfurniturebank.org/)

![dallas-furniture-bank](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2023-02-23-at-10.38.15-AM.png)

Dallas Furniture Bank is located in Carrollton, just north of Irving. It’s a furniture bank that accepts lightly used furniture, so it’s among the best options to consider on this list if your mattress is relatively new, unused, and in good condition.

_They will not accept old or dirty mattresses. So make sure your mattress is less than 5 years old, doesn't have stains, tears, pet hair or Bed bugs._

If it is in good condition, [Dallas Furniture Bank](https://www.dallasfurniturebank.org/) will even pick it up for a fixed charge of $50, all week between 11am and 3pm.

What’s more is how Dallas Furniture Bank gives all donated furniture to the homeless and those living in poverty, which makes it a great option in Irving if you want to support a good local cause. 

To request a mattress pickup (you have to request before it’s approved), just fill in the online form on their website.

## Option #3: Drop-off At [Hunter Ferrell Landfill](http://cityofirving.org/545/Landfill-Administrative-Complex)

![irving-tx-landfill](/filtered-images/Document.jpeg)

While we always recommend recycling or donating your mattress first, that may not always be an options. In that case Hunter Ferrell Landfill Scalehouse and Administration Complex is a landfill located at:

110 E. Hunter Ferrell Road in Irving.

It’s open from 7am to 5:30pm, Monday to Saturday, with tipping fees starting from $12 per 500 pounds of waste.

So if you have access to a pickup truck, van, or similar vehicle that’s big enough to transport a mattress, [Hunter Ferrell Landfill](https://www.cityofirving.org/545/Landfill-Administrative-Complex) is another way that you can dispose of a mattress in Irving.

Needless to say, this is self-disposal - so you’ll need to do the heavy lifting and transport, plus pay the cost depending on how much your mattress weighs.

But despite that, it’s still an option worth considering in the local area if you need to get rid of a mattress as soon as possible.

We recommend calling before showing up. Many landfills across the country are starting to change their rules when it comes to mattresses. Some no longer accept them at all and others charge additional fees.  
This is due to the fact that mattresses do not compress or breakdown very well and end up taking up a lot of valuable space in landfills.

## Option #4: Sell It On [Craigslist](https://dallas.craigslist.org/) Or Facebook Marketplace

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is still in good condition (no tears, stains, pet hair, or damage), then it’s well worth considering selling it for cash or giving it away instead of disposing of it.

Believe it or not there is a large market for used mattresses. Many people would prefer an affordable used mattress over spending hundreds or thousands on a new one.

It’s also a good idea to check out similar listings online to get an idea of what price to sell it for. Of course, the fairer and more attractive the price, the [quicker it will sell](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/) if you need to get rid of your mattress in a hurry.

Also make sure to take nice photos and ensure potential buyers that there are no stains or bed bugs present. Happy selling!

## Option #8: DIY - Do It Yourself Mattress Recycling

![inside-lux-midnight-mattress](/filtered-images/IMG_3264-768x1024.jpeg)

Last but not least, DIY recycling is a great option. If you have the tools and some spare space, DIY mattress recycling is another option for getting rid of a mattress if you’re strapped for cash or just want to be resourceful.

It’s also environmentally friendly, as the materials—usually foam, and steel—can be given away locally and recycled to make other items.

Just cut the cover off and separate the foam and metal inside. The metal can be taken to a local scrap metal dealer where they will likely give you some cash for it. The foam can be dropped at a local carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding (call first to make sure they will accept your foam).
