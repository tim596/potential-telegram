## Option #3: Donate Your Mattress

![local-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

Most of the donation centers we contacted are VERY selective on the types of mattresses they accept. Call before dropping off.

If your mattress is newer and in good condition, you can look for thrift stores and donation centers that will accept its. However, be aware that many donation centers don’t accept mattresses, due to safety concerns. 

For mattresses in good condition, a donation center can be a way of ensuring the longevity of the mattress, and providing someone in need with a comfortable place to sleep.

Before donating your mattress, give it a close inspection for any rips, stains, or damage. Then call the donation center to ensure they will accept it. [Goodwill](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/), [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/il/montgomery/fox-valley-hfh) and [Salvation Army of Aurora](https://centralusa.salvationarmy.org/aurorail/) are some of the most popular options locally.

While some donation centers do offer pickups, many services will only accept drop-offs. Keep this in mind if you choose a donation center.

## Option #4: Giveaway Or Sell On Facebook Marketplace Or Craigslist

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

New mattresses [can be very expensive](https://www.abedderworld.com/most-expensive-mattresses.html/), so there is a healthy resale market. If your mattress is in good condition, with no stains or damage, then you might be able to make money [selling your mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/) online.

And even if you don’t make money, you can potentially get rid of your old mattress with very little effort.

Good places to sell include Facebook Marketplace, and the [Chicago Craigslist](https://chicago.craigslist.org/?postal=60502&search_distance=33) page. To increase the likelihood of a sale, take nice photos of the mattress, so that it looks more appealing.

It also helps if you can list the type of mattress, and how old it is and ensure that it has no stains or rips.

Offering the mattress for free with pickup can expand your potential customer range, and help you get rid of a big and bulky household item with minimal effort.

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![inside-lux-midnight-mattress](/filtered-images/IMG_3264-768x1024.jpeg)

If you have the time, and the space, then it is possible to recycle your old mattress! It isn’t an easy task, but it does mean you can ensure an old mattress that can’t be sold isn’t taking up space in a landfill.

You can find instructions on how to take apart an old mattress [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/). The mattress is essentially divided into three separate components: the fabric cover, the foam interior, and the metal bed springs. 

The next step is to find a recycling center for each individual item.

For the cover, look for a fabric recycling center or it may need to go in the trash.

After that, it’s time to recycle the mattress springs. These are made of metal, so you should be able to sell them at a scrap metal facility. They’ll weigh the springs, and pay you depending on the weight.

It isn’t a lot of money, but it’s a nice bonus, and worth the effort of finding a scrap metal center. Try [S & S Metal Recyclers II](https://www.ssmetalrecyclers2.com/), or [Aurora Metal Recycling](https://www.aurorametal.com/).

Finally, the foam. You can call around to local carpet manufacturers and find one that can use it to make carpet padding. They may even pay you a little money for it.

## Option #6: Dropoff Your Mattress At A [Local Landfill](https://www2.illinois.gov/epa/topics/waste-management/landfills/Pages/landfill-locations.aspx)

![landfill-las-vegas](/filtered-images/WE_WastePile.jpeg)

If you really can’t find anything else to do with your mattress, you may need to drop it off at a landfill. However, as mattresses are big items that don’t decompress, not all landfills will accept old mattresses.

Before throwing your old mattress into a landfill, contact the landfill first to check that it is accepted. They can also tell you any form of ID required to gain access to the center, and if there are any fees.
