## Option #2: Donate It Locally

If your mattress is in good condition you may want to consider donating it to an organization that will find people who can use it.

IMPORTANT: Many of the major donation centers like [Goodwill](https://www.goodwillnwohio.com/donation-stations/), [Salvation Army](https://southernusa.salvationarmy.org/lubbock/), etc... DO NOT accept mattresses anymore.

But luckily, there are a few donation centers that do accept mattresses in good condition...

### Donation Location #1: [Lubbock Habitat Restore](https://lubbockhabitat.org/restore)

## Option #3 - Drop off at [Citizen Convenience Station](https://ci.lubbock.tx.us/departments/solid-waste-management/services/citizen-convenience-stations)

![city-of-lubbock-logo](/filtered-images/city-of-lubbock-logo.png)

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress whenever possible, before sending it to the landfill. Mattresses take up a lot of space in our cities landfills and do not compress efficiently. However, if recycling or donating are not an option and you have a means for transporting your bed, you can bring your mattress to one of the citizen convenience stations and drop it off.

Unlike some cities, Lubbock doesn’t have a maximum usage policy. Many cities only allow the use of their recycling centers twice or 3 times a month. Lubbock however, doesn’t explicitly mention a restriction on its website.

However, you do have to provide evidence that you live in the area. To do this, you need to bring an official Lubbock utility bill to the station or provide your driving license with a Lubbock address as your main residence.

The Citizen Convenience Station will take garage doors, bulky furniture, tree limbs as well as your mattress.

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Lubbock's Craigslist](https://lubbock.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in decent shape you may want to consider giving it away or selling it online. There is a large market of people looking to get a lightly used mattress for a discount rather than spending hundreds to thousands on a new one. If you are willing to go the craigslist or facebook route you can almost certainly get rid of a mattress as long as it doesn't have any sanitary concerns or major issues.

For a successful sale be sure to take nice pictures and ensure potential buyers that it does not have any stains and is bed big free. Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![man-tearing-open-an-old-mattress](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-1024x572.webp)

If you want to save some money and do the environment a favor you can opt to recycle your mattress yourself. This is a small project that includes the physical tearing apart of the mattress followed by the recycling of each material inside (metal and foam). We have a full article [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

To start you will want to tear off the cover and separate the metal and foam materials inside.

You can take the metal to a local scrap metal yard where they will likely even give you some cash for it. They will then melt it down and recycle it.

You can take the foam to a local business like a carpet manufacturer where they will use it to make carpet padding. Check craigslist for people looking for used foam and call around and you will be able to find someone who will take it off your hands.

Home For Foam was launched by Texas Tech University after the 2021 pandemic restrictions. During that time, the university changed their mattresses, cups, packing materials, and trays. 

These waste products were not accepted by the local government, which meant the university was seeing large quantities of recyclable materials going to landfills. To stop this tragedy, Home For Foam was created.

There are a couple of facilities dotted around the area to help students and the public recycle their foam with ease. To find your nearest location, click [here](https://www.homeforfoam.com/recycling/).

The foam is turned into picture frames, molding for homes, and even rulers.

You can even add the recycling equipment to your offices or large sites using their “[Get Started](https://www.homeforfoam.com/get-started/)” program.
