If your mattress is in good condition you may want to consider donating it to someone who can use it. While the majority of donation centers throughout Peoria DO NOT accept mattresses, the South Side Mission does accept them in GOOD CONDITION.

IMPORTANT: You mattress must be in nice condition and lightly used to be donated. This donation center will NOT accept mattresses that are older, have stains or rips or are not structurally sound.

Before donating your mattress, it is important to check with the organization to make sure they still accept mattresses and need them at that time. In addition, only donate mattresses that are in good condition, as organizations will not accept mattresses that are stained or damaged.

If you don’t want your mattress to end up in a landfill but also don’t want to pay any fees, then you can try taking your mattress to your nearest recycling center yourself. 

Unfortunately, the current nearest mattress recycling center to Peoria, Illinois, is the [Green Spring Recycling Center](https://greenspringrecycling.com/) in Chicago.

Understandably, this is still a very long drive to do just for the sake of one mattress but if you are heading to Chicago anyway and you have room in your vehicle for your mattress, then why not take it along? 

You should first give the Green Spring Recycling center a call (call them at 262-412-1011)

While the Peoria County Landfill does offer the possibility to dispose of large items like mattresses, it should be seen as an alternative rather than a first choice due to environmental considerations. Donating or recycling your mattress is more eco-friendly, helping to reduce landfill waste and reuse valuable resources. However, if these options aren't feasible, the landfill remains a viable option to responsibly manage unwanted items. Please ensure to verify the operating hours and disposal guidelines before heading there.

The County and City of Peoria co-own the municipal waste facility (landfill) located at [11501 W Cottonwood Road in Edwards, IL](https://goo.gl/maps/CigxuwNN1y3z6paJA) (off Route 8, near Wildlife Praire State Park). It is also referred to as Landfill Number 2. 

Landfill Number 2 is operated by Waste Management. Oversight of operations is handled through the City/County Landfill Committee, which meets monthly. Find agenda items and meeting dates on the City of Peoria's website: [Solid Waste Disposal Committee (Landfill) | Peoria, IL (peoriagov.org)](https://www.peoriagov.org/618/Solid-Waste-Disposal-Committee-Landfill)

If your mattress is under 5 years old and has no tears or stains, then it’s still in good enough shape to be reused. So - why not try selling your old mattress online to see if you can get some cash for it instead? 

Selling your old mattress is a great idea because not only will you get some money in return that can go towards your new mattress, but the buyer can come and pick up your mattress. So, you get someone else to take your mattress for free! 

There are a lot of great platforms you can use to sell your old mattress but some of the most popular are likes of [Craigslist](https://peoria.craigslist.org/), [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), and [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/113848465291957/). Take some pictures of your mattress, upload them online, and see what offers you get for your old mattress.

## Option #6: [DIY Recycle Your Own Mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

If you are willing to get your hands a little dirty, then you can try to recycle your mattress yourself. To do this, all you need to do is tear up your mattress and start separating the materials in different bags. 

Certain manufacturers will take parts of your mattress but not the whole thing but if you are willing to separate the materials, it’s much easier to get recycle your mattress.

For example, some textile manufacturers use the fabric of mattresses to make things like dog beds or horse blankets, while the springs can be melted down and reused to make any metal components.

So, tear up your old mattress and check with local manufacturers to see if any want to take the materials off your hands.
