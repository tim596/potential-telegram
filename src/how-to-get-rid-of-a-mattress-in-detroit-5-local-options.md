All you need to do is enter your ZIP code onto their website and you can book and pay for your mattress removal with 100% up front pricing.

![detroit-bulky-item-removal-instructions](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2023-02-06-at-7.02.19-PM-1024x627.png)

You may be eligible to have your mattress picked up curb-side from the City of Detroit’s bulk collection service from the Department of Public Works. So long as your mattress covers less than two cubic yards and weighs less than 1000 pounds.

If you want to have your mattress collected by the Department of Public Works, you should contact them through their contact form. They’ll respond within 24 hours and give you a quote. When filling in your form, they may request a photograph of what you want them to collect.

Always ensure that you provide an accurate photograph of your mattress, and if they accept, you’ll need to follow the guidelines for leaving bulk waste outside. All they ask is when you leave your mattress outside, you leave it so it can be easily accessed from the front curb.

You should always ensure that you also leave it out by 7 AM on the scheduled collection day, but never over 24 hours before. Once you’ve been accepted for a paid collection, they will take payment by a cashier's check, credit card, or money order. 

Bulk waste is only allowed to cover two cubic yards and must be in front of your household.

## Option #4: Donate It To a Charity Or Thrift Shop

![local-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

Is your mattress in great condition? Could someone still get some life out of it? If so, you may be able to donate it to a charity or a thrift shop.

TYPICAL MATTRESS DONATION RULES:

- Less than 5 years old with manufacturing [tags still on the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/mattress-tags.html/)

- No rips, tears or stains

- Bagged and cleaned before dropping off

- Still structurally sound without any sagging

- CALL FIRST before dropping a mattress.

While many charities have stopped mattress donations due to sanitary concerns, some charities will still accept them.

Consider donating to the [Salvation Army](https://centralusa.salvationarmy.org/greatlakes/), and check any other local thrift stores. If you are wondering if [Goodwill](https://www.goodwilldetroit.org/) accepts mattresses you can check our article about their policies [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/)...

When donating, make sure that your mattresses are in good condition. So, ensure there aren’t any bed bugs, stains, rips, or anything you wouldn’t want.

If your mattress is in good condition, you might be able to get it off your hands. After all, new mattresses are expensive, which may be great for anyone in need.

## Option #5: Sell It Online (On [Detroit Craigslist](https://detroit.craigslist.org/) or Facebook Marketplace)

If your mattress is in good condition you may be able to make a little extra cash, why not sell it on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace?

As we mentioned before, new mattresses are expensive, so someone is always looking for an affordable one online. If there aren’t bed bugs, stains, or rips this could be a great option.

Keep in mind that you need to take some nice photos of your [mattress when you're selling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/) it online. Reassure any prospective buyers that there aren’t any bed bugs or stains to put their minds at ease.

You can also recycle your mattress yourself, and we’ve even created a helpful guide to help you do so.

All you need is space and some simple tools, and you’ll be able to take apart the components that keep your mattress together.

As you’re in Detroit, you should be able to donate the materials to any factories or warehouses that may be interested in them.
