![indianapolis-mattress-disposal-services-banner-image](/filtered-images/Most-Attractive-Youtube-Thumbnail-2023-02-26T153532.806-1024x576.png)

Are you a resident of Indianapolis or the surrounding areas looking to get rid of an old mattress?

When it comes to getting rid of a mattress, there is always confusion based on the best way to get rid of one. Disposal laws are different all around the country, with many donation centers and landfills no longer accepting mattresses at all. So knowing exactly how to get rid of one can be difficult.

Luckily, Indy has quite a few options available that residents can take advantage of. We have listed some great options below, from a curbside mattress recycling service to donation and drop pff options.

## Option #2: Donate at [Mustard Seed of Central Indiana](https://mustardseedindy.org/#:~:text=We%20collect%20donations%20of%20gently,home%20with%20Mustard%20Seed%20families.)

![mustard-see-mattress-donation-center](/filtered-images/MustardSeed_Small2.jpeg)

IMPORTANT: _Due to infestation outbreaks of bedbugs and sanitary concerns, a lot of charities that previously accepted mattresses in Indianapolis, no longer accept them._

HOWEVER, there is still the [Mustard Seed of Central Indiana](https://mustardseedindy.org/#:~:text=We%20collect%20donations%20of%20gently,home%20with%20Mustard%20Seed%20families.) who will accept furniture that has been gently used, including mattresses!

You will need to make sure that your mattress is in a state that it can be donated, and that it fits the description of gently used. (Less than 5 years old, no rips or stains and still has its structural integrity)

Essentially, can it still be slept on? You want to be donating a mattress that can feasibly be used again by someone who needs it!

## Option #3: Drop It Off At The [South Side Landfill](https://www.ssidelandfill.com/) (or an affiliated transfer station)

![south-side-landfill-logo](/filtered-images/ssl-logo-web-header.png)

Although we always recommend recycling or donating first, another option is to drop-off your mattress at the landfill.

You should check the updated rules and fees beforehand as they are constantly changing.

Most of the landfills in the state of Indiana will accept mattresses but they will usually require an extra fee. On top of this, getting a mattress to the landfill yourself will require a truck or larger vehicle.

#### **SOUTH SIDE LANDFILL  
**2561 Kentucky Avenue  
Indianapolis, IN 46221

### OR AT ONE OF THE AFFILIATED  
TRANSFER STATIONS

#### **Mt. Comfort Transfer Station**  
2751 N 600 West  
Greenfield, IN 46140

#### **Franklin Transfer Station**  
730 Industrial Drive  
Franklin, IN 46131

#### **Rock Hampton Transfer Station**  
5350 Rock Hampton Ct.  
Indianapolis, IN 46268

## Option #4: Sell Or Giveaway on [Craigslist](https://indianapolis.craigslist.org/) of Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

This is another option that can work if your mattress is gently used.

There is a large market for used mattresses. You can often find people on online marketplaces like Facebook Marketplace, or Craigslist, that are willing to take, and sometimes even buy mattresses.

These marketplaces often let you set your own rules, so you can choose if you are willing to deliver or to only accept pickups.

If you advertise giving away a mattress to anyone who is willing to pick it up, and especially if it is in good condition, this can end up saving a lot of money with a disposal service, of course this is with the caveat that someone will be willing to use your mattress.

Make sure to take nice pictures and ensure potential buyers that there are no stains and no bed bugs.

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![inside-lux-midnight-mattress](/filtered-images/IMG_3264-768x1024.jpeg)

Want to save money and be resourceful, why not recycle your mattress yourself. To do this you will cut the cover off and separate the foam and metal inside.

Take the metal to a scrap metal yard, they will weigh it and give you cash for it. They then melt it down and recycle it.

You can take the foam to a carpet manufacturer in the Indianapolis area. They will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. Be sure to call before showing up as not all carpet manufacturers will accept used foam from the public.

## Option #6: Use A Junk Company

Some of the top rated junk removal options advertised on search engines include [Fire Dawgs Junk Removal](https://firedawgsjunkremoval.com/), and [Junk King Indianapolis](https://www.junk-king.com/locations/indianapolis?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=local&utm_campaign=yext)

These are the more local services that have been used and trusted by locals, however there are other services available in Indianapolis that could give you a better deal, or might have a better option for you.

The best thing about most of these services is that they will take all kinds of junk so you can get rid of a bunch of items at once.

If you are willing to spend a little extra and have lots of junk, this is a great option. It is important to note that with a junk company your mattress will likely end up in the landfill.

## Indianapolis Mattress Disposal FAQ

### **Can You Dispose Of A Mattress In A Dumpster In Indianapolis?**

Unless your dumpster provider has advertised that they will accept mattresses, this is not a practice that is allowed in Indianapolis.

Most of the municipal trash collectors will not accept a mattress, and this can sometimes land you a fine if you try it. It is worth researching, but in most cases this is not allowed.

### **Can You Use Disposal Services If Your Mattress Has Bed Bugs?**

Most trash disposal services will not accept mattresses that have been contaminated with any active infestations like carpet or bed bugs.

If they have been treated, there is a much higher chance that these mattresses will be accepted.

### **How Much Does A Mattress Disposal Service Cost?**

Generally speaking, a mattress disposal service in Indianapolis will cost you somewhere in the $100 range, however, this depends on different factors, like where you are located specifically, the size of your mattress, and if you want anything else disposed of as well!

## **Summary**

Hopefully this guide has given you all the information you need on how to get rid of a used mattress in Indianapolis.

If your mattress can be reused, we recommend trying to sell or give it away online, and if this does not work, then donating it or recycling.
