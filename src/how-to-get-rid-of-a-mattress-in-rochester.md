IMPORTANT: You mattress must be in nice condition and lightly used to be donated. This donation center will NOT accept mattresses that are older, have stains or rips or are not structurally sound.

If your mattress is in good condition you may want to consider donating it to someone who can use it. While the majority of donation centers throughout New York DO NOT accept mattresses, Family Promise does accept them in GOOD CONDITION.

### Donating:

The following new or gently used items are used to distribute to our families when they move into their new home from shelter or for families receiving support for shelter diversion. **Storage at our Day Center is limited; _PLEASE CALL_ before delivering: 506-9050.**

- **Furniture** – mattresses and box springs (twin, double/full, or queen), bed frames; also occasionally kitchenette-style tables and chairs, sturdy living room chairs.

- Towels (1 set/person)

- Bedding & pillows: Twin sheet sets and comforter

Before donating your mattress, it is important to check with the organization to make sure they still accept mattresses and need them at that time.

We always recommended recycling or donating mattresses before taking them to the landfill, as mattresses take up a lot of space and do not decompose easily. If neither of these options is available, you can drop your mattress at the high acres landfill for a small fee.

If your mattress is in usable condition and you think someone could get some more life out of it you can list it on one of the local marketplaces and likely have it taken off your hands pretty quickly. A lot of people are looking to get a deal on a mattress rather than spend hundreds or thousands on a new one.

Just be sure to take nice pictures and emphasize the cleanliness of your mattress to put their mind at ease. Who knows they may even [pay you some cash for your mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/).

Recycling a mattress yourself and getting rid of the materials in Rochester is not an easy task, but it is possible with the right tools and knowledge of where to take them. Here are some steps on how to recycle a mattress yourself and how to dispose of the foam and metal inside:

1. Disassemble the Mattress - The first step is to disassemble the mattress. Use a sharp utility knife or scissors to cut through the fabric and remove the outer layer of the mattress. Once you have removed the outer layer, you will be able to access the foam and metal springs inside.

3. Remove the Foam - To remove the foam, use the utility knife or scissors to cut the foam into small pieces. You can then put the foam pieces in a large garbage bag or container to transport. If the foam is in good condition, you can take it to a carpet manufacturer for recycling into carpet padding.

5. Remove the Metal Springs - To remove the metal springs, use pliers or a wire cutter to cut the springs into smaller pieces. You can then collect the metal pieces in a container for transporting to a recycler. Many [scrap metal recycling centers in Rochester](https://www.metalicorochester.com/) accept metal springs and will pay you for the metal.

7. Dispose of the Remaining Materials - After you have removed the foam and metal, you will be left with the fabric covering and any other materials that were used in the construction of the mattress. These materials can be disposed of in your regular garbage or used for DIY projects.

_It's important to note that recycling a mattress yourself can be a time-consuming and difficult process, especially if you don't have the right tools or experience. If you're unable or unwilling to recycle a mattress yourself, you may want to consider hiring a professional mattress recycling service or contacting a local recycling center to see if they accept mattresses for recycling._

## To Conclude

We know that throwing your old mattresses away is often much easier said than done, and we know just how daunting the task can be. You can also contact the [City of Rochester](https://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589936438) and see if they offer mattress removal with your trash service, although note that this service will go to the landfill.

So, we hope that this guide has proven helpful and that you now feel fully equipped to dispose of your old mattresses in a way that is efficient and great for the planet.
