If you live in Greensboro and are looking for a way to get rid of an old mattress, you have come to the right place. North Carolina has begun to implement more strict mattress disposal regulations with many donation centers and landfills no longer accepting them.

Luckily, there are still some great mattress disposal options available to residents. In this article we have included 5 local options from a statewide curbside mattress recycling service to donation and drop off options.

If your mattress is in good condition you may want to consider donating it to an organization that will find people who can use it.

IMPORTANT: The major donation centers like [Goodwill](https://www.triadgoodwill.org/shop/?gclid=CjwKCAjw_YShBhAiEiwAMomsEPiQXmXzRxZNeT-90fwwPc0bns1LIfASp29ZQwyiDIoNXbc9oaXvbRoCntsQAvD_BwE), [Habitat for Humanity](https://habitatgreensboro.org/), etc... DO NOT accept mattresses anymore.

But luckily, the Barnabas Network of Greensboro does accept mattresses and furniture in good condition.

![city-of-greensboro-logo](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-7.30.02-PM.png)

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress before sending it to the landfill. Mattresses are hard to compress and break down and take up a lot of unnecessary space. If this is your only option you can drop your mattress at the Solid Waste Transfer Station of Greensboro.

### The Solid Waste Transfer Station

**Address**: 6310 Burnt Poplar Rd., Greensboro, NC 27409

**Hours**: Mondays through Fridays from 6 am to 5 pm, and Saturdays from 7 am to 1 pm. Please arrive at least 30 minutes before closing to allow for time to unload materials. 

**Phone:** 336-373-CITY (2489)

The Solid Waste Transfer Station only accepts municipal solid waste (household trash), bulk trash (couches, mattresses, etc.), and construction debris (C&D) that is generated within Guilford, Alamance, Caswell, Chatham, Davidson, Davie, Forsyth, Montgomery, Randolph, Rockingham, and Stokes County.

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Greensboro's Craigslist](https://greensboro.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in decent shape you may want to consider giving it away or [selling it online](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/). There is a large market of people looking to get a lightly used mattress for a discount rather than spending hundreds to thousands on a new one. If you are willing to go the craigslist or facebook route you can almost certainly get rid of a mattress as long as it doesn't have any sanitary concerns or major issues.

For a successful sale be sure to take nice pictures and ensure potential buyers that it does not have any stains and is bed big free. Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

If you want to save some money and do the environment a favor you can opt to recycle your mattress yourself. This is a small project that includes the physical tearing apart of the mattress followed by the recycling of each material inside (metal and foam). We have a full article [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

To start you will want to tear off the cover and separate the metal and foam materials inside.

You can take the metal to a local scrap metal yard (like [Foils Recycling)](https://www.foilsinc.com/Greensboro-Metal-Recycling.asp) where they will likely even give you some cash for it. They will then melt it down and recycle it.

You can take the foam to a local business like a carpet manufacturer where they will use it to make carpet padding. Check craigslist for people looking for used foam and call around and you will be able to find someone who will take it off your hands.

We hope this article helped you to find a way to get rid of your mattress that works with your budget and your specific mattress condition. Greensboro luckily has quite a few more options available to residents than many other cities across the country.
