It can be difficult to get rid of an old mattress. Landfills nationwide are restricting mattresses from being dumped at their facilities – mattresses take up a lot of space (26 sq. ft. on average) and they don’t compress. Most [donation](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) centers do not accept mattresses anymore due to unsanitary conditions and bed bugs.

## Option #3: Take it to a [Local Landfill](https://www.broward.org/WasteAndRecycling/SouthwestRegionalLandfill/Pages/Default.aspx)

If you’ve got a truck, and a strong back, you can take your mattress to a landfill. There are still landfills in the Fort Lauderdale area that accept mattresses. There is a fee for each mattress and there is usually an entrance or a gate fee as well. If you live inside certain districts, you can call and request for them to pick it up for an additional fee. The downside to this is that, well…your mattress will go into a landfill:

[Broward County Landfill](https://www.broward.org/WasteAndRecycling/SouthwestRegionalLandfill/Pages/Default.aspx) – 7101 S.W. 205 Ave. near the intersection of Sheridan Street and U.S. 27.

## Option #4: Post it on [Fort Lauderdale’s Craigslist](https://Miami.craigslist.org) Page or on FaceBook Marketplace

There are many people looking for a good deal on a gently used mattress. If your mattress is in decent condition, you may be able to sell it, or give it away. Be sure to take nice pictures of it and state that it does not have stains and does not have bed bugs! This will help to attract a buyer.

## Option #5: [Donate Your Mattress](https://gyr.fortlauderdale.gov/greener-government/recycling-waste-reduction/solid-%20waste-yard-waste-recycling-services/green-your-routine-waste-disposal-directory/oversized-items.)

![local-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

Due to the sanitary concerns and an increasing prevalence of bed bugs, most nonprofits around the country are no longer accepting mattresses at their donation centers. Luckily, there are donation centers in Fort Lauderdale who do take mattresses. There is a great local government site that lists the places you can take your mattress, or to call and have it picked up. Alternatively, you can offer it to someone you know – a family member or friend who could use your mattress.

## Option #6: Do it Yourself Mattress Recycling Project

Do what we do – recycle your mattress yourself! We have a great step-by-step guide on our blog post on how to tear apart a mattress or boxspring yourself. A sharp knife, like a carpet knife, works well - cut along the sides and remove the cover. Separate the foam from the steel. You can most likely take the steel to your local recycling center. You might find a local carpet manufacturer who will use the foam for carpeting underlayment. Or you might find a use for the foam around your home…like to make a pillow or a dog bed. Be creative!
