## Option #3: Drop Your Mattress at a Local [Richmond Disposal Center](https://www.rva.gov/public-works/bulk-and-brush) (Landfill)

![richmond-va-city-logo](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2023-04-07-at-8.33.48-PM.png)

We always recommended recycling or donating mattresses before taking them to the landfill, as mattresses take up a lot of space and do not decompose easily. If neither of these options is available, you can drop your mattress at one of 2 Richmond disposal centers or schedule a pick up.

- Residents can dispose of bulk/brush on their own at:
    - **East Richmond Road Convenience Center**   
        3800 East Richmond Road   
        Monday - Friday     7 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.  
        Saturday                 8:30 a.m. - 2:00 p.m.

If your mattress is in usable condition and you think someone could get some more life out of it you can list it on one of the local marketplaces and likely have it taken off your hands pretty quickly. A lot of people are looking to get a deal on a mattress rather than spend hundreds or thousands on a new one.

Just be sure to take nice pictures and emphasize the cleanliness of your mattress to put their mind at ease. Who knows they may even [pay you some cash for your mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/).

Recycling a mattress yourself and getting rid of the materials in Richmond is not an easy task, but it is possible with the right tools and knowledge of where to take them. Here are some steps on how to recycle a mattress yourself and how to dispose of the foam and metal inside:

1. Disassemble the Mattress - The first step is to disassemble the mattress. Use a sharp utility knife or scissors to cut through the fabric and remove the outer layer of the mattress. Once you have removed the outer layer, you will be able to access the foam and metal springs inside.

3. Remove the Foam - To remove the foam, use the utility knife or scissors to cut the foam into small pieces. You can then put the foam pieces in a large garbage bag or container to transport. If the foam is in good condition, you can take it to a carpet manufacturer for recycling into carpet padding.

5. Remove the Metal Springs - To remove the metal springs, use pliers or a wire cutter to cut the springs into smaller pieces. You can then collect the metal pieces in a container for transporting to a recycler. Many [scrap metal recycling centers in Richmond](https://smithironmetal.com/) accept metal springs and will pay you for the metal.

7. Dispose of the Remaining Materials - After you have removed the foam and metal, you will be left with the fabric covering and any other materials that were used in the construction of the mattress. These materials can be disposed of in your regular garbage or used for DIY projects.

_It's important to note that recycling a mattress yourself can be a time-consuming and difficult process, especially if you don't have the right tools or experience. If you're unable or unwilling to recycle a mattress yourself, you may want to consider hiring a professional mattress recycling service or contacting a local recycling center to see if they accept mattresses for recycling._
