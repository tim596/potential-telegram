If you live in Buffalo and are looking to get rid of an old mattress you may have noticed they are hard items to get rid of. Many landfills and donation centers throughout New York no longer accept them due to their inability to compress as well as sanitary concerns.

Luckily, there are some mattress disposal services and options available to residents that still make it easy to dispose of that old mattress. From a statewide curbside mattress recycling service to a donation option and drop off locations, we have included something for [every budget](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-much-does-mattress-removal-cost-price-of-5-popular-services.html/) and every mattress condition.

## Option #2: Donate to [Buffalo City Mission](http://www.buffalocitymission.org/thrift-store/) or [SHP Buffalo](http://www.buffalocitymission.org/thrift-store/)

If you mattress is n decent condition and could be used by someone else you could consider donating it. All of the major donation centers ([Goodwill](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/), [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitatbuffalo.org/), [St. Vincent De Paul](http://svdpwny.org/acceptable-items/), etc...) in Buffalo NO NOT accept mattresses. But luckily a few donation centers do accept mattress if they are somewhat newer and do not have any stains, rip, or tears.

This can be a great way to let someone in need be able to get a comfortable mattress to sleep on without having to spend hundred to thousands of dollars.

### Donation Center #1: [Buffalo City Mission](http://www.buffalocitymission.org/thrift-store/) Thrift Store

The Buffalo city mission thrift store works with much of the homeless community in Buffalo to help them get back on their feet and into a home with furniture (including mattresses). They will only accept mattresses, box springs, frames etc..... that are in good condition and that someone can still comfortbaly and sanitarily use. This is a great organization within the community and a wonderful place to donate a mattress or other furniture.

### Donation Center #2: [Sleep in Heavenly Pease - Buffalo](https://shpbeds.org/chapter/ny-buffalo/)

Sleep in Heavenly Peace has a Buffalo chapter that services the local community. They make beds for kids who do not have a bed to sleep in. Some of the children they help don't even have a pillow to sleep on. Call before donating your mattress to see if they can use it but this is a great organization and a wonderful home for a lightly used mattress to help children who greatly appreciate it.

_You can also try the AMVET thrift store as they often need used furniture in good condition as well . [https://www.supportthevets.org/](https://www.supportthevets.org/)_

## Option #3: Drop-Off at the [East Side Transfer Station](https://www.wmsolutions.com/locations/details/id/894) (Landfill)

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress before bringing it to the landfill. Mattresses do not compress down well and take up a lot of unnecessary space in our landfills. If none of the other options works well for you and you have a means to transport your bed then you can always bring your mattress to the East side Transfer Station in Buffalo for a fee.

Buffalo, NY 14260

Credit Card Customers and Buffalo Resident Hours:  
7:00am-9:00am and 1:00pm to 3:00pm

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Craigslist](https://buffalo.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in decent shape you may want to consider giving it away or [selling it online](_wp_link_placeholder). There is a large market of people looking to get a lightly used mattress for a discount rather than spending hundreds to thousands on a new one. If you are willing to go the craigslist or facebook route you can almost certainly get rid of a mattress as long as it doesn't have any sanitary concerns or major issues.

For a successful sale be sure to take nice pictures and ensure potential buyers that it does not have any stains and is bed big free. Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![man-tearing-open-an-old-mattress](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-1024x572.webp)

If you want to save some money and do the environment a favor you can opt to recycle your mattress yourself. This is a small project that includes the physical tearing apart of the mattress followed by the recycling of each material inside (metal and foam). We have a full article [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

To start you will want to tear off the cover and separate the metal and foam materials inside.

You can take the metal to a local scrap metal yard (like [https://www.niagarametals.com/](https://www.niagarametals.com/)) where they will likely even give you some cash for it. They will then melt it down and recycle it.

You can take the foam to a local business like a carpet manufacturer where they will use it to make carpet padding. Check craigslist for people looking for used foam and call around and you will be able to find someone who will take it off your hands.
