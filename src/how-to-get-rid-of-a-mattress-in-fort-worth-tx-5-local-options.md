Getting rid of an old mattress is getting to be harder and harder as landfills and donation centers across Texas are placing more strict rules on mattresses. Many do not accept mattresses at all.

If you live in Fort Worth and are looking to get rid of an old mattress we have compiled a list of 5 great options that residents can take advantage of. From curbside mattress recycling pick ups to drop off and donation options.

## Option #2: [Donate it](https://goodwillnorthcentraltexas.org/)

![local-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

If your mattress is in good condition (less than 5 years old, no rips, no stains, no bed bugs) you can try to donate it at one of the many local donation centers in Fort Worth. Mattresses are [expensive](https://www.abedderworld.com/most-expensive-mattresses.html/) and there are many people who can benefit from a used mattress rather than having to spend hundreds or thousands on a new one. [Goodwill](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/), [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/tx/fort-worth/fort-worth-area-hfh-inc), [Fort Worth Salvation Army](https://salvationarmyntx.org/north-texas/)

UPDATED NOTE: Many of the donation centers we contacted in Fort Worth are no longer accepting mattresses. The ones that do accept mattresses only do so when in great condition (we recommend calling first)

## Option #3: [Government Run Drop Off Stations](https://www.fortworthtexas.gov/departments/code-compliance/solidwaste/dropoff)

https://youtu.be/ZrmDE-th2gE

To use the facility, you will need a recent water bill or current driver's license which shows Fort Worth as your home address. 

While we always recommend recycling first if that is not an option you can take your mattress to a drop off location for disposal in the landfill.

The government has 4 drop-off stations in the city, all of which accept mattresses and box springs.

Unfortunately, you cannot use commercially labeled vehicles to pick up your mattress. Only single-axle trailers are allowed into the area.

If you don’t own a single-axle trailer, you can rent one from [U-Haul](https://www.uhaul.com/Locations/Truck-Rentals-near-Fort-Worth-TX-76104/836071/), [Lowe’s](https://www.lowes.com/store/TX-Fort-Worth/0525), or [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/l/Ft-Worth/TX/Fort-Worth/76109/542).

The drop-off stations are open from 8 am to 6 pm Monday through Friday, and 8m to 5 pm on Saturday. They are not open on Sundays.

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Craigslist](https://dallas.craigslist.org/ftw/) or Facebook Marketplace

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

There is a large market of people in Fort Worth who are looking to [buy lightly used mattresses](https://budgetfriendlyfurnishing.com/selling-a-mattress-on-craigslist-all-you-need-to-know/) rather than buying a new one for hundreds or thousands of dollars.

If you mattress is in decent you may want to consider giving it away or selling it on Facebook or craigslist.

Just make sure you take nice photos and put any potential buyers mind at ease by specifying that the mattress does not have any rips, stains or bed bugs.

This is a great way to save or make some money and help someone out who can use the rest of whatever life your mattress has left in it.

![inside-lux-midnight-mattress](/filtered-images/IMG_3264-768x1024.jpeg)

If you wan to take matters into your own hands and be eco-friendly you can try recycling your mattress yourself.

Simply tear open your mattress and separate the foam and metal.

The metal can be dropped at a local scrap metal dealer where they will weigh it out and pay you some money for it.

The foam can be dropped at a carpet manufacturer who will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding.
