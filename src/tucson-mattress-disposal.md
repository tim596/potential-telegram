### _Overview: Mattress Disposal In Tucson_

[Tucson](https://www.visittucson.org/visit/about/around-tucson) has a variety of options for getting rid of mattresses and oversized furniture. While the city does not have a dedicated [mattress recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/) facility they do have a variety of options at your disposal, some of which are more eco-friendly than taking them to the [landfill](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/mattress-landfill-crisis-recycling-nightmare). From drop-ff and donation options to mattress pick up and removal services, we have listed all of the easiest and convenient ways to get fid of a mattress and all related accessories throughout Tucson, Oro Valley and the surrounding area. 

With the rise in online mattress purchases, there is also a rise in the need for customers to get rid of their old mattresses, as online companies do not generally pick up old mattresses from their customers. This has given rise to more and more local options for residents to get rid of hard to dispose of items like mattresses and furniture.

If your mattress is in decent condition, it is very probable that someone may want to use it.

## Option #5: DIY Mattress Recycling Project

![](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-768x429.png)

If you are a DIY and like taking on projects why not recycle your mattress yourself. This could be a great way to teach your kids about being resourceful or just a fun way to save some money and the environment. By recycling your mattress you can save on average 26sq.ft. of landfill space. We have a great step-by-step blog post on [how to break down and recycle your own mattress.](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/) Along with another post on [how to recycle your box spring yourself](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-box-spring/). To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for the foam.

Overall, when it comes to getting rid of a mattress in the the Tucson area, you do have quite a few options at your disposal. If you have any questions or need any help disposing of your old mattress feel free to contact us or leave a comment below and we would be happy to lend a hand in helping you find a resource to get rid of your mattress. Just please don't dump it on the side of the road or leave it in someones [dumpster](https://www.abedderworld.com/get-rid-of-a-mattress-by-throwing-it-in-the-dumpster.html/). Ultimately, that becomes somebody else's problem to dispose of and it will generally cost them money out of pocket to do so.
