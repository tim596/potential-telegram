## 2\. [Drop-off at a Mobile Area Landfill](https://www.cityofmobile.org/trashpickup/landfill.php "Links active once published")

Although its unfortunate to throw a mattress in the landfill when there are so many alternative options, sometimes it is the only available disposal method. Mobile has many landfills in the area so if you are all out of options and you have a truck, the landfill may be your only resource. Landfills often change rules on items they receive (especially mattresses) as well as alter their pricing. It is best to call the landfill before you take the trip over there, to be sure you can get it off your hands.

​Below is a list of landfills in the Mobile area along with their contact info and hours of operation. [![Picture](/filtered-images/screen-shot-2018-06-23-at-7-39-50-pm.png)](https://www.cityofmobile.org/trashpickup/landfill.php "Links active once published")

## 3. [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.budgetdumpster.com/blog/how-to-break-down-mattress-and-box-spring/ "Links active once published")

Mobile doesn't have a mattress recycling program of their own, so if you want to dispose of your mattress with minimal impact on the environment you can recycle it yourself. [Budget Dumpster](https://www.budgetdumpster.com/blog/how-to-break-down-mattress-and-box-spring/ "Links active once published") has a great step-by-step blog ​post on how to break down and recycle your own mattress. To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for the foam.
