If you live in Huntsville and are looking for a way to get rid of an old mattress, you have come to the right place. Alabama has begun to implement more strict mattress disposal regulations with many donation centers and landfills no longer accepting them.

Luckily, there are still some great mattress disposal options available to residents. In this article we have included 5 local options from a curbside mattress recycling service to donation and drop off options.

## Option #2: Donate to [The Downtown Rescue Mission](https://www.downtownrescuemission.org/thrift-stores)

If your mattress is in good condition you may want to consider donating it to an organization that will find people who can use it. The major donation centers like [Goodwill,](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) [St Vincent De Paul](https://svdphuntsvilleal.org/), [Habitat for Humanity](https://habitatrivervalley.org/restore/), etc... DO NOT accept mattresses anymore.

But luckily, the Downtown Rescue Mission does accept mattresses and furniture ONLY in good condition. They help homeless families get back on their feet and into a home and the homes are furnished with your donations.

## Option #3: Drop-Off at the [Solid Waste Disposal Authority Landfill](http://swdahsv.org/)

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress before bringing it to the landfill whenever possible. Mattresses take up a lot of space in our landfills and do not compress properly. However, sometimes the landfill is the only option. If that is the case and you have a means of transporting your mattress, you can bring it to the SWDA landfill in Huntsville.

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Huntsville's Craigslist](https://huntsville.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in decent shape you may want to consider giving it away or [selling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/) it online. There is a large market of people looking to get a lightly used mattress for a discount rather than spending hundreds to thousands on a new one. If you are willing to go the craigslist or facebook route you can almost certainly get rid of a mattress as long as it doesn't have any sanitary concerns or major issues.

For a successful sale be sure to take nice pictures and ensure potential buyers that it does not have any stains and is bed big free. Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![man-tearing-open-an-old-mattress](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-1024x572.webp)

If you want to save some money and do the environment a favor you can opt to recycle your mattress yourself. This is a small project that includes the physical tearing apart of the mattress followed by the recycling of each material inside (metal and foam). We have a full article [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

To start you will want to tear off the cover and separate the metal and foam materials inside.

You can take the metal to a local scrap metal yard (like [SIMS Metal](https://www.simsmm.com/locations/huntsville-alabama/)) where they will likely even give you some cash for it. They will then melt it down and recycle it.

You can take the foam to a local business like a carpet manufacturer where they will use it to make carpet padding. Check craigslist for people looking for used foam and call around and you will be able to find someone who will take it off your hands.

We hope this article helped you to find a way to get rid of your mattress that works with your budget and your specific mattress condition. Huntsville luckily has quite a few options available.
