## Option #2: [Government Bulk Waste Centers](https://www.plano.gov/895/Bulky-Waste-Accepted-Items#:~:text=Contact%20NTMWD%20at%20972%2D442,the%20121%20Regional%20Disposal%20Facility.) (Drop off)

![plano-tx-city-logo](/filtered-images/Homepage.png)

The local government has created 4 drop-off stations for the people of Plano. In these stations, you can dump your mattresses as well as other bulky items such as lawnmowers, grills, and furniture.

### IMPORTANT DRO OFF INFO!

- You can only access the area twice a month. If you have more waste to dispose of, you’ll have to wait until your usage time has come back around.

- The centers are free to use unless you go over this 2-limit rule. The exact charge amount isn’t noted on their website.

- When you arrive, your mattress cannot be half out of your car. In fact, if the mattress is even slightly “over spilling” you will not be allowed into the area. For this reason, many residents rent a larger passenger vehicle or pickup truck for the journey. But note that trailers are not accepted.

- When you arrive, you need to show an official utility bill for the last month or a driver's license - either of which should prove you live in the area. Without this documentation, you will not be allowed to use the facilities.

## Option #3 - DIY [Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![inside-lux-midnight-mattress](/filtered-images/IMG_3264-768x1024.jpeg)

If you want to become more self-sufficient, you can try breaking down your mattress yourself. We have a [whole article](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/) dedicated to this process. 

Click the link above to find the step-by-step tutorial. In the end, you will be left with a spring unit, foam, and cover. The cover cannot be recycled, so will need to be thrown into general waste, or upcycled into something new.

The spring unit is largely recyclable. You can go to a scrap yard and sell the metal for cash. The scrap yard will then melt down the metal and get it back out into the world of construction.

The foam can be recycled at a local carpet manufacturer (call first). They will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding.

## Option #4 - Sell or Giveaway on [Craigslist](https://dallas.craigslist.org/search/sss?query=mattress#search=1~gallery~0~0) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/filtered-images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in good condition, it would be wasteful to recycle the materials. Instead, consider selling the item on websites such as Craigslist.

There are a whole host of people [selling their old mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/), earning anything from FREE to $500.

Compare the quality of your [mattress with the others online](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-a-bed-in-a-box-worth-it.html/). Make sure to keep the brand in mind too.

When posting a picture of your mattress, make sure to take nice pictures and point out any flaw ahead of time. Also ensure potential buyers that there are no stains and no bed bugs.

## Option 5: [Donate it](https://goodwilldallas.org/)

![local-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

_UPDATE: Unfortunately all donation centers we contacted are [no longer accepting mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) at their facilities due to the health risk of bed bugs and sanitary issues._

Donating your mattress can be a great way to ensure the entire life of your mattress is used and will help someone who may not be able to afford the hundreds and even thousands of dollars that a new mattress costs. We recommend contacting the donation center before showing up as their regulations on which mattresses they accept are becoming stricter and stricter each year.

## Option #5: Lots of Junk? Try [Junk Luggers](https://www.junkluggersofcollincounty.com/mattress-removal.html)

Junk Luggers is a full service junk removal company in Plano. They take almost anything and can offer you a free estimate for your trash.

However, Junk Luggers does not offer an easy-to-gauge price on their website. Instead, you need to send them your information for them to analyze first.

The estimate they offer you will not be the final price. This is because they may hire additional labor for your request and charge you for this later. However, mattress removal rarely requires more than their original [estimated pricing](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-much-does-mattress-removal-cost-price-of-5-popular-services.html/).

They may ask for a photo of your items or a phone call to discuss the matter further.
