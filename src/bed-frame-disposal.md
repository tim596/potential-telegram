## What Are Bed Frames Made of?

[Bed frames](https://www.abedderworld.com/low-bed-frames.html/) come in a variety of types and materials. The majority are comprised of metal, wood and occasionally some fabric. 

## 01: WOOD

### Used to make wood Chips

Many mattress recycling centers will extract the [wood from a bed frame](https://www.abedderworld.com/wooden-rustic-platform-beds.html/) and utilize it to make wood chips. The hard part about recycling the wood is that it must be completely free of all metals and fabrics. 

## 02: STEEL

### Melted down and Recycled

Most frames are made mostly of metal. This metal is separated from the wood and fabric and is recycled as scrap metal. The metal is then melted down and reused in other finished goods. 

## 03: FABRIC

### Shredded and thrown out.

The fabric covering makes up less than 10% of most frames and is the only piece that can not be recycled. The fabric is shredded up, bailed and thrown out.
