![does-salvation-army-accpet-mattresses-banner-image](/filtered-images/Most-Attractive-Youtube-Thumbnail-2023-03-23T101508.501-1024x576.png)

If you are in the process of getting rid of an old mattress you may have found that many landfills and donation centers no longer accept them for disposal or donation. But does Salvation Army accept mattresses?

We contacted Salvation Army locations throughout the country and talked to some of the highest up representatives. The answer to whether they take mattresses varies based on location. Read on to find out if your local branch accepts mattresses or not...

The Salvation Army's policies on accepting mattress donations can vary by location. Some Salvation Army locations may accept mattress donations, while others may not, depending on factors such as local regulations, the condition of the mattress, and available storage space.  
  
To find out if a Salvation Army location near you accepts mattress donations, it is best to contact the local branch directly. You can visit their website ([https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/](https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/)) and use the location search tool to find the contact information for your nearest Salvation Army location. Once you have this information, call or email them to inquire about their specific policies on mattress donations.

IMPORTANT: _Keep in mind that if you are donating a mattress, it should be in good condition, free from stains, and not infested with bed bugs or other pests. Many organizations, including the Salvation Army, have strict guidelines on the quality and condition of donated items to ensure that they can be safely and effectively distributed to those in need._

## 2\. Try Another Local Donation Center

![local-mattress-donation](/filtered-images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

Many people think of Salvation Army, [Goodwill](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) and [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/) as the primary options when donating a mattress or box spring. However, many of these organizations no longer accept mattresses due to bed bug and sanitary concerns. But luckily there are often many local donation centers that accept mattress donations and put them to good use. 

Any donation center will provide a receipt for tax purposes and will often pick up the mattress for free. The mattresses are then given to those in need or resold to raise money for various programs.

Another great option is local shelters. Many local shelters accept mattress donations and put them to good use. The mattresses are often given to people who need them or are sold in their thrift stores to raise money for the shelter.

Hospitals often accept mattress donations as well. The mattresses are used for patients in need and are often replaced after being used for some time. 

[Several organizations](https://charity.lovetoknow.com/charitable-donation-resources/best-mattress-donation-options-which-ones-pick-up) specialize in mattress donations. These organizations often accept gently used mattresses and either give them to those in need or resell them. Several of those organizations include:

- Vietnam Veterans of America

- St. Vincent de Paul Society

- Furniture Bank

- Pick Up Please

- Purple Heart

- ReStore

- Sleep in Heavenly Peace

While people enjoy the ease of dropping off donations at places like Salvation Army, there's no need to give up if your local store doesn't take mattress donations or you don't have an easy option. 

## 3\. Sell or Giveaway Online

Luckily, social media has made getting rid of things we no longer need even easier than loading the stuff into a car and dropping it off at a donation center. 

Your favorite social media platforms, such as Facebook and Nextdoor, offer neighborhood pages where users can post anything—even free stuff!

Simply searching on these platforms can help you locate "for free" groups in your area that allow users to post about stuff they are trying to donate. These postings are usually free and allow users to notify a large group of people who may require a mattress. All you need to do is post about your mattress, and you have a significant chance to get rid of an old mattress in only a few hours.

But the best part of this method is that others seeking a free mattress will come and take it off your hands without you lifting a finger. After all, a mattress can be a heavy item, and your lower back is less spry these days. 

## 4\. Local Trash Service OR Landfill

![landfill-las-vegas](/filtered-images/WE_WastePile.jpeg)

Trashing your mattress is not the best way to rid yourself of an old mattress, but it is the only option available for some people.

If you have exhausted all your mattress removal options, then [trashing it](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-information/mattress-disposal-guide) may be the best course for you. 

But before you dump it on the curb in front of your residence, you should call the city. Many cities and towns offer mattress disposal programs. Check with your local municipality to see if mattress recycling programs are available. These programs often require you to pay a small fee, but it can be worth it if you want to keep your mattress out of the landfill.

You can also locate your town or municipality recycling center. These are generally large facilities near the local landfill where you can get rid of your used mattress and finally dispose of that pizza box that's been sitting in your kitchen for a week. Of course, you'll have to have a [car big enough to transport the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/7-best-car-air-mattresses-buyer-guide.html/), but at least it's one way to dispose of it responsibly.  

If you want to avoid hassle with the details of disposing of your used mattress, you can always hire a junk removal service. Most services offer free estimates and will take care of the entire process. That process includes coming to your home with a truck, having several employees carry it out of your home, and taking it to a recycling center or other facility designed to break down the material.

You can also rent a [dumpster](https://www.abedderworld.com/get-rid-of-a-mattress-by-throwing-it-in-the-dumpster.html/) if you handle the disposal process yourself. This option is great if you're working on a larger project and need to dump other things like debris from a home renovation or excess yard debris. 

## Conclusion

Getting rid of your mattress doesn't have to end with a trip to Salvation Army. Unfortunately, many Salvation Army stores do not accept mattress donations. While that might be frustrating for many, a phone call or a Google search usually yields a service, charity, or recycling center that will gladly take a mattress off your hands.
