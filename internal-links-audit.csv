To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for it."

This adds up to almost **1 billion sq.ft. of landfill space.** The problem with mattresses and box springs ending up in landfills is that they do not compress or breakdown like other trash. Mattresses leave what they call ""soft spots"" in the landfill where they cannot compress trash into the earth, causing for wasted landfill space. Many landfills and [states across the country are banning mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/) and box springs or are charging large fees due to the inconvenience they cause and the space they take up. Mattress recycling is becoming more important than ever and we are proud to say that we have helped recycle over 300K mattresses and box springs and saved over 7 million sq. ft of landfill space in Colorado alone! We have laid out some steps below that you can take to recycle a box spring yourself."

With only a few mattress disposal options available, DIY mattress recycling might be the right option for you. Aside from getting a great workout, you will feel good about your impact on environment preservation and conservation. Budget Dumpster has a great step-by-step blog ​post on how to break down and recycle your own mattress. To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for the foam."
