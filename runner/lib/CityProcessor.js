## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: QUALITY-FIRST APPROACH
**MANDATORY**: Never create pages in bulk or batches. Each city must be completed individually with full quality verification before starting the next city.

### üéØ **QUALITY OVER SPEED - NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES**
- **Take time for research**: Understand each city's unique character, challenges, and community features
- **Write original content**: Every section must be genuinely unique and valuable to users
- **Focus on user needs**: Content should genuinely help people in that specific city
- **Verify all details**: Check neighborhood names, ZIP codes, local regulations, and facilities
- **Test thoroughly**: Build site and verify content displays correctly before marking complete
- **One city excellence** is better than multiple rushed pages that need fixes later

## Research Phase
- **MANDATORY: Research unique city characteristics and positioning** (different from all existing pages)
- Identify 15-20 specific neighborhoods with ZIP codes

### **üéØ MANDATORY: "Same Facts, Different Angles" for Key Sections**
- **Collect factual base data**: Waste company name, recycling facilities, regulations, stewardship program details
- **Identify city's unique context**: What makes THIS city's residents experience these facts differently? (tech growth, university, geography, housing types, economic drivers, etc.)
- **Write through local lens**: Present same facts but explain WHY they matter to THIS city specifically and what unique challenges/benefits they create for local residents

### **üîß CRITICAL: Waste Management & Recycling Infrastructure Research**
- **MANDATORY: Research local waste management companies** (EDCO, Republic Services, Waste Management, etc.)
- **MANDATORY: Identify specific mattress recycling facilities in the area**
- **MANDATORY: Research county/city mattress disposal regulations** (wrapping requirements, licensed haulers)
- **MANDATORY: Find local Bye Bye Mattress program details or state recycling programs**
- **MANDATORY: Locate licensed disposal sites and transfer stations**
- **MANDATORY: Research environmental compliance requirements** (documentation, preparation)
- **USER FOCUS: How does this impact actual customer experience?** (pickup requirements, preparation steps)

## Content Generation - Excellence Standards
- **MANDATORY: Write completely original content from scratch** (NO template language or copy-paste)
- **RESEARCH-DRIVEN CONTENT**: Use genuine city knowledge to create truly helpful, location-specific content
- **USER-FOCUSED VALUE**: Every paragraph should answer real questions people have about mattress removal in this city

### **üé® CRITICAL: Writing Style Variation**
- **VARY SENTENCE STRUCTURES**: Different opening approaches, paragraph lengths, transitions between cities
- **VARY EMPHASIS POINTS**: Lead with community values vs. programs vs. environmental benefits (rotate approaches)
- **VARY VOICE & RHYTHM**: Mix active/passive voice, short/long sentences, different organizational patterns
- **UNIQUE COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS**: Same facts (EDCO, county programs) but different community tie-ins
- **NO REPETITIVE PHRASING**: Avoid identical sentence patterns from other cities (even if facts are similar)

- **CONCISE CONTENT RULE: Maximum 20 words per sentence, focus on clarity over length**
- **NO FILLER WORDS: Avoid "comprehensive," "sophisticated," "extensive," "thoroughly," "discrete"**
- **CRITICAL: Create unique city positioning** (different character/focus from all other pages)
- **QUALITY CHECK**: Read content aloud - does it sound natural and genuinely helpful?
- Create 3 authentic customer reviews focused on **mattress removal service experience** - NOT city lifestyle (**completely unique scenarios**)
  - **CRITICAL: Reviews must sound like real customers describing actual mattress pickup experiences**
  - **Focus on service details**: timing, team professionalism, logistics, pricing satisfaction
  - **Avoid city tourism language**: No "I love living here" or city promotional content
  - **Casual, conversational tone**: Use natural language, contractions, everyday speech patterns
  - **Specific service scenarios**: Moving situations, home renovations, bed replacements, apartment turnovers
  - **Real logistics details**: Stairs, elevators, parking, scheduling, team coordination
  - **Neighborhood mentions**: Include area names naturally in context, not as city promotion
  - **UNIQUE OPENINGS**: Avoid repetitive starter phrases across cities ("Called them," "Had an old," "We needed")
- Write 8 service-focused FAQs with practical customer questions (**6+ service-focused, 1-2 location-specific max**)
  - **CORE TOPICS**: Pricing, scheduling, service area coverage, what's included, licensing/insurance
  - **PRACTICAL QUESTIONS**: "How quickly can you pick up?", "Do you handle upstairs?", "What's included?"
  - **AVOID**: Extensive city details, cultural information, historical context
- Optimize content for "[City] mattress removal" and related keywords (**natural, non-repetitive**)

## üèÜ HIGH-QUALITY SEO DOMINANCE RULES

### Core Quality Principles
- **USER-FIRST CONTENT**: Every sentence must provide genuine value to users searching for mattress removal
- **SEARCH INTENT FULFILLMENT**: Answer what users actually want to know, not what we want to say
- **ACTIONABLE INFORMATION**: Include specific details users can act on (pricing, timing, process)
- **LOCAL RELEVANCE**: Connect service to genuine local needs, challenges, or benefits
- **EXPERTISE DEMONSTRATION**: Show knowledge through specific details, not generic claims

### Uniqueness Mandates  
- **80%+ UNIQUE CONTENT**: Every city must be <30% similar to any existing city page
- **UNIQUE ANGLES**: Each city needs a distinct angle/focus that no other city uses
- **NO CONTENT RECYCLING**: Never reuse paragraphs, sentences, or even phrase structures
- **VARIED SENTENCE STRUCTURE**: Different opening patterns, lengths, and flow from all other cities
- **ORIGINAL EXAMPLES**: All scenarios, benefits, and descriptions must be city-specific

### Content Quality Standards
- **SPECIFIC > GENERIC**: "Navigate narrow Victorian staircases" vs "handle all access challenges" 
- **CONCRETE > ABSTRACT**: "Coordinate with HOA security gates" vs "work with community guidelines"
- **PRACTICAL > PROMOTIONAL**: "Next-day pickup for $125" vs "unmatched service excellence"  
- **INFORMATIVE > MARKETING**: Focus on what, when, how, where - not why we're amazing
- **SCANNABLE**: Use short paragraphs, bullet points, clear structure for mobile users

### Anti-Spam/Anti-Pattern Rules
- **NO KEYWORD STUFFING**: City name should appear naturally, not forced repeatedly
- **NO SUPERLATIVE OVERUSE**: Avoid "best," "premier," "#1," "leading" unless genuinely differentiated
- **NO GENERIC BENEFIT LISTS**: Skip "licensed, insured, eco-friendly" unless explaining why it matters locally
- **NO FAKE URGENCY**: Avoid "call now," "limited time," or manufactured scarcity tactics
- **NO MANUFACTURED AUTHORITY**: Skip "years of experience" claims unless specific and relevant

### Local Value Integration
- **GENUINE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE**: Mention specific landmarks, geography, or local quirks that show real familiarity  
- **LOCAL PROBLEM SOLVING**: Address actual challenges residents face (parking, building types, regulations)
- **COMMUNITY CONNECTION**: Reference local waste programs, regulations, or environmental initiatives
- **NEIGHBORHOOD AUTHENTICITY**: Use actual neighborhood names in context, not as keyword dropping
- **NO DEMOGRAPHIC/ETHNICITY REFERENCES**: Avoid mentioning racial, ethnic, or demographic characteristics unless directly service-relevant (e.g., multilingual support needs)
- **SEASONAL/TEMPORAL RELEVANCE**: Include factors like weather, traffic patterns, local events that affect service

### Content Structure Excellence
- **FRONT-LOADED VALUE**: Most important information in first 100 words
- **LOGICAL FLOW**: Information organized by user decision-making process
- **SCANNABLE HIERARCHY**: Clear headings that guide users to what they need
- **MOBILE-OPTIMIZED**: Short sentences, brief paragraphs, easy thumb scrolling
- **FAQ INTEGRATION**: Address real questions users have about mattress removal process

## Technical Implementation  
- **CENTRALIZED TEMPLATE ONLY: Use layout: location.njk in frontmatter**
- **FRONTMATTER DATA ONLY: Provide only YAML frontmatter with all required fields**
- **NO MARKDOWN CONTENT: All content goes in pageContent: frontmatter section**
- **NO HTML: Template handles all HTML structure automatically**
- **NO CSS: All styling is centralized in template**
- Add complete frontmatter with coordinates, neighborhoods, pricing
- **Add pageContent: section with city-specific content variables**`;

    const prompt = `You are a markdown file generator. Your ONLY job is to output raw markdown file content for ${city.name}, ${city.state}.

${launchCityRequirements}

You MUST use the EXACT template structure from Denver's source page (/src/mattress-removal/colorado/denver.md) - DO NOT use basic Markdown format, DO NOT create your own template.

Generate a COMPLETE markdown file with:
- Frontmatter: layout: location.njk, title, description, permalink, city, state, stateSlug, tier, coordinates, pricing, pageContent, neighborhoods, zipCodes, nearbyCities, reviews: {count: featured: []}, faqs
- Phone number: 720-263-6094 throughout
- Next-day language (never same-day)  
- Unique ${city.name}-specific research: real neighborhoods, ZIP codes, local details
- 3 unique customer reviews about mattress removal service
- 8 location-specific FAQs
- Minimum 1000+ words of unique, researched content

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT write "I have researched..." or "Research completed" or any explanatory text
- Do NOT write summaries, introductions, or conclusions
- Do NOT write "Here is the content..." or similar phrases
- Your response must start with "---" and end with the last line of the markdown file
- Output ONLY the raw markdown content that would be saved directly to a .md file
- Think of yourself as a markdown file generator, not a conversational assistant
