## Google SEO Guidelines & Penalty Analysis

### Google's Core Ranking Factors for Local SEO (2024-2025)

#### Primary Local Ranking Signals
Google's local search rankings are determined by three fundamental factors:
- **Relevance**: How well your business matches what users are searching for
- **Distance**: Physical proximity to the searcher's location
- **Prominence**: How well-known and established your business is

#### E-E-A-T Framework Evolution
Google's E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) framework has become more sophisticated:
- **Experience** has been added as the fourth pillar
- Human evaluators use E-E-A-T to assess content quality standards
- While not a direct ranking factor, E-E-A-T sets the benchmark for high-ranking content

#### Mobile-First Indexing Impact
- 60% of mobile searches have local intent
- Core Web Vitals are particularly crucial for local businesses
- Mobile page speed directly impacts local search visibility

#### Google Business Profile Optimization
Your GBP remains the single most important local SEO asset:

- Customer reviews quantity and quality significantly impact rankings

### Google Penalty Criteria and Risks (2024-2025)

- 750,000 manual penalties issued monthly since 2020
- 50% of penalized sites contained 90-100% AI-generated content

#### Doorway Page Penalties
Google's stance on location-based doorway pages has intensified:
- Creating 1,300+ city landing pages without physical presence triggers penalties

- Pages that funnel users to the same destination are flagged as doorway pages

#### New Spam Policies (2024)
Three new spam policy categories were introduced:
1. **Scaled Content Abuse**: Mass production of content primarily for rankings
2. **Site Reputation Abuse**: Third-party content on high-authority sites for ranking manipulation
3. **Expired Domain Abuse**: Repurposing expired domains to boost low-quality content rankings

### Location Page Best Practices

#### Content Uniqueness Requirements

### Content Quality Guidelines (2024-2025)

### Red Flags and Warning Signs

#### Manual Action Triggers
