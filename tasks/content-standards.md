# Content Standards for Location Pages

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (User Feedback)

**Problem Identified**: Chicago suburbs created at scale had insufficient content depth and too much duplication between pages. Quality fell apart when prioritizing speed over uniqueness.

**MANDATORY STANDARDS - NO EXCEPTIONS**:
1. **High-quality, helpful content** focused on user needs (no arbitrary word count requirements)
2. **80%+ unique content** between pages - content must be genuinely valuable and city-specific
3. **Follow complete launch-city.md process** for every single page
4. **ONE PAGE AT A TIME ONLY** - Never create pages in bulk or batches

## CRITICAL CONTENT UNIQUENESS RULE (MANDATORY)

**THE UNIQUENESS IMPERATIVE**: 
- **EVERY page must be 80%+ unique** from all other location pages
- **NO template language** - Each page must feel completely original
- **NO copy-paste content** between cities, even with minor edits
- **UNIQUE positioning** - Each city needs its own distinct character and focus
- **UNIQUE scenarios** - Reviews, FAQs, and examples must be completely different
- **MANDATORY verification** - Check uniqueness against all existing pages before completion

**Quality Control Process**:
1. ✅ Research unique city characteristics and positioning
2. ✅ Write completely original content from scratch  
3. ✅ Verify 80%+ uniqueness against existing pages
4. ✅ Test build and functionality
5. ✅ Final quality review before marking complete
6. ✅ Only then move to next city

**ZERO TOLERANCE for duplicate content patterns** - If any page falls below 80% uniqueness, it must be completely rewritten.

## CRITICAL CONTENT RULES

### Quality Over Speed Rule (MANDATORY)
**Problem**: When doing bulk city creation, quality was sacrificed for speed, resulting in incomplete pages.

**MANDATORY RULE**: 
- **NEVER prioritize speed over quality** - Every single page must meet full requirements
- **ALWAYS follow complete launch-city.md process** even when doing bulk operations
- **NO shortcuts allowed** - Each city gets full research, content development, and quality verification
- **Each page must be complete** before moving to the next city
- **Verify high-quality, helpful content** and all required sections before marking as complete

**Quality Checkpoints for Every City**:
1. ✅ Complete research phase (demographics, neighborhoods, regulations)
2. ✅ Full content generation (all 8 required sections)
3. ✅ High-quality content verification (no filler content)
4. ✅ 70%+ unique content verification
5. ✅ All required frontmatter fields
6. ✅ Natural, casual customer reviews
7. ✅ SEO-safe keyword distribution
8. ✅ Complete neighborhood coverage (15-20 areas)
9. ✅ Build test passes
10. ✅ Final quality review

### Customer Review Standards (MANDATORY)
**Problem**: Reviews sounded too marketing-focused and polished, plus focused too much on city details instead of service.

**Requirements**:
- **SERVICE FOCUS**: Reviews must focus on actual mattress removal experience
- **Casual, authentic tone** - Reviews must sound like real customers, not marketing copy
- **Natural language** - Use conversational phrases, contractions, and everyday speech patterns
- **Personal context** - Include specific life situations (moving, renovation, new baby, furniture upgrade)
- **Local references** - Mention actual neighborhoods naturally but briefly
- **Varied review lengths** - Mix shorter (80-100 words) and longer (120-150 words) reviews
- **SERVICE DETAILS**: Mention crew professionalism, timing, equipment, cleanup
- **PRACTICAL CONCERNS**: Address real service challenges (upstairs removal, tight spaces, timing)
- **Authentic emotions** - Express genuine satisfaction without over-the-top promotional language
- **SPECIFIC SERVICE DETAILS** - Include mattress types, pickup timing, crew interaction
- **AVOID CITY FOCUS**: Don't elaborate on city history, culture, architecture
- **UNIQUE CONTENT RULE** - Each review must be distinctly different from others, avoid template patterns

**Examples of Natural Review Language**:
- ✅ "We needed to get rid of our old mattress pretty quickly when we moved to our new place in [neighborhood]..."
- ✅ "The guys showed up right on time and didn't have any trouble getting our king mattress down those narrow stairs..."
- ❌ "A Bedder World exceeded all expectations with their exceptional service delivery and outstanding professional expertise..."

### SEO Keyword Guidelines (MANDATORY)
**Problem**: Risk of keyword stuffing penalties while trying to hit keyword targets.

**Requirements**:
- **Primary keyword density**: 0.5-1.0% for "[City] mattress removal" (NEVER exceed 1.5%)
- **Natural keyword placement**: Only use keywords where they fit naturally in sentences
- **Keyword variations**: Use synonyms and related terms (pickup, disposal, recycling, service, hauling)
- **Avoid repetition**: Don't repeat exact keyword phrases in consecutive paragraphs
- **Focus on user value**: Write for humans first, search engines second
- **Long-tail keywords**: Include natural phrases like "mattress pickup in [City]" or "dispose of old mattress"
- **LSI keywords**: Include related terms like "furniture removal," "recycling," "waste disposal," "bed removal"

**Keyword Distribution Strategy**:
- Title tag: Include primary keyword once
- H1: Include primary keyword once
- Content: Spread variations naturally throughout high-quality, helpful content
- Reviews: Use conversational variations ("getting rid of our mattress," "mattress pickup")
- FAQs: Include natural question variations

**Safe Keyword Variations to Rotate**:
- "mattress removal"
- "mattress pickup" 
- "mattress disposal"
- "mattress recycling"
- "bed removal"
- "old mattress pickup"
- "furniture removal"
- "waste disposal"
