# City Launch Checklist

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: QUALITY-FIRST APPROACH
**MANDATORY**: Never create pages in bulk or batches. Each city must be completed individually with full quality verification before starting the next city.

### üéØ **QUALITY OVER SPEED - NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES**
- **Take time for research**: Understand each city's unique character, challenges, and community features
- **Write original content**: Every section must be genuinely unique and valuable to users
- **Focus on user needs**: Content should genuinely help people in that specific city
- **Verify all details**: Check neighborhood names, ZIP codes, local regulations, and facilities
- **Test thoroughly**: Build site and verify content displays correctly before marking complete
- **One city excellence** is better than multiple rushed pages that need fixes later

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ONE PAGE AT A TIME ONLY
**MANDATORY**: Complete each city fully before starting the next. This ensures maximum quality and prevents errors.

## Research Phase
- [ ] **MANDATORY: Check cities.md first to determine city hierarchy** (Major Metro, Metro, or Suburb)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: If listed under "### [Metro] Suburbs", MUST use nested URL structure**
- [ ] Research city demographics, population, metro area
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Research unique city characteristics and positioning** (different from all existing pages)
- [ ] Identify 15-20 specific neighborhoods with ZIP codes

### **üéØ MANDATORY: "Same Facts, Different Angles" for Key Sections**
- [ ] **Collect factual base data**: Waste company name, recycling facilities, regulations, stewardship program details
- [ ] **Identify city's unique context**: What makes THIS city's residents experience these facts differently? (tech growth, university, geography, housing types, economic drivers, etc.)
- [ ] **Write through local lens**: Present same facts but explain WHY they matter to THIS city specifically and what unique challenges/benefits they create for local residents
- [ ] **Examples of approach**:
  - Same fact: "Waste Management requires advance scheduling"
    - University town: "...especially challenging during move-out periods when student housing generates high volume"
    - Tech hub: "...complicated by gated community access protocols in newer developments"
    - Hilly area: "...requires coordination for difficult access situations on steep terrain"

### **üîß CRITICAL: Waste Management & Recycling Infrastructure Research**
- [ ] **MANDATORY: Research local waste management companies** (EDCO, Republic Services, Waste Management, etc.)
- [ ] **MANDATORY: Identify specific mattress recycling facilities in the area**
- [ ] **MANDATORY: Research county/city mattress disposal regulations** (wrapping requirements, licensed haulers)
- [ ] **MANDATORY: Find local Bye Bye Mattress program details or state recycling programs**
- [ ] **MANDATORY: Locate licensed disposal sites and transfer stations**
- [ ] **MANDATORY: Research environmental compliance requirements** (documentation, preparation)
- [ ] **USER FOCUS: How does this impact actual customer experience?** (pickup requirements, preparation steps)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Include ALL suburbs from cities.md for the metro area**
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Verify metro pages link to state page, suburb pages link to metro page**

## Content Generation - Excellence Standards
- [ ] **MANDATORY: Write completely original content from scratch** (NO template language or copy-paste)
- [ ] **RESEARCH-DRIVEN CONTENT**: Use genuine city knowledge to create truly helpful, location-specific content
- [ ] **USER-FOCUSED VALUE**: Every paragraph should answer real questions people have about mattress removal in this city

### **üé® CRITICAL: Writing Style Variation**
- [ ] **VARY SENTENCE STRUCTURES**: Different opening approaches, paragraph lengths, transitions between cities
- [ ] **VARY EMPHASIS POINTS**: Lead with community values vs. programs vs. environmental benefits (rotate approaches)
- [ ] **VARY VOICE & RHYTHM**: Mix active/passive voice, short/long sentences, different organizational patterns
- [ ] **UNIQUE COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS**: Same facts (EDCO, county programs) but different community tie-ins
- [ ] **NO REPETITIVE PHRASING**: Avoid identical sentence patterns from other cities (even if facts are similar)

- [ ] **CONCISE CONTENT RULE: Maximum 20 words per sentence, focus on clarity over length**
- [ ] **NO FILLER WORDS: Avoid "comprehensive," "sophisticated," "extensive," "thoroughly," "discrete"**
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Create unique city positioning** (different character/focus from all other pages)
- [ ] **QUALITY CHECK**: Read content aloud - does it sound natural and genuinely helpful?
- [ ] Create 3 authentic customer reviews focused on **mattress removal service experience** - NOT city lifestyle (**completely unique scenarios**)
  - **CRITICAL: Reviews must sound like real customers describing actual mattress pickup experiences**
  - **Focus on service details**: timing, team professionalism, logistics, pricing satisfaction
  - **Avoid city tourism language**: No "I love living here" or city promotional content
  - **Casual, conversational tone**: Use natural language, contractions, everyday speech patterns
  - **Specific service scenarios**: Moving situations, home renovations, bed replacements, apartment turnovers
  - **Real logistics details**: Stairs, elevators, parking, scheduling, team coordination
  - **Neighborhood mentions**: Include area names naturally in context, not as city promotion
  - **UNIQUE OPENINGS**: Avoid repetitive starter phrases across cities ("Called them," "Had an old," "We needed")
- [ ] Write 8 service-focused FAQs with practical customer questions (**6+ service-focused, 1-2 location-specific max**)
  - **CORE TOPICS**: Pricing, scheduling, service area coverage, what's included, licensing/insurance
  - **PRACTICAL QUESTIONS**: "How quickly can you pick up?", "Do you handle upstairs?", "What's included?"
  - **AVOID**: Extensive city details, cultural information, historical context
- [ ] Optimize content for "[City] mattress removal" and related keywords (**natural, non-repetitive**)

## üèÜ HIGH-QUALITY SEO DOMINANCE RULES

### Core Quality Principles
