Mattresses cannot be placed in regular curbside pickup and must be handled by certified waste management companies. New Berlin's established subdivision network creates specific service considerations: Glengarry Highlands and other 1950s-1970s neighborhoods feature mature landscaping that requires careful driveway navigation, many homes have attached garages with direct bedroom access for convenient pickup, subdivision streets often have narrow turning radii requiring smaller service vehicles, and professional residents prefer scheduled appointments that work around commuter schedules to Milwaukee. Our licensed service eliminates disposal complexities - we maintain required Waukesha County certification, coordinate with approved recycling facilities, and handle proper documentation. Choose professional pickup over navigating county drop-off requirements and scheduling conflicts." reviews: count: 187 featured: - reviewer: "Michael K." rating: 5 text: "Super convenient service!
