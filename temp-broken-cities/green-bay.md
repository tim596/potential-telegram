With over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide, we bring reliable service to Wisconsin's Fox River community." aboutService: | <p>When you need a mattress gone in Green Bay, you shouldn't have to navigate Brown County's different drop-off rules or drive to the transfer station on South Broadway during a Wisconsin winter. We bring the solution directly to you. Our service has processed over 1 million mattresses through nationwide recycling networks, delivering that expertise to your doorstep whether you live near Lambeau Field in Ashwaubenon or along the Fox River in De Pere.</p> <p>Green Bay families call us when they're upgrading bedrooms, moving between healthcare jobs at Bellin or Aurora, or clearing space after adult kids head back to college. We understand the community's rhythm - working around shift schedules in the area's major medical centers, avoiding seasonal traffic during busy periods, and planning for Wisconsin's harsh winter months when getting bulky items out becomes a real challenge.</p> <p>Instead of trying to haul mattresses in your truck during a snowstorm or waiting until spring for municipal pickup, we handle everything year-round. Our team knows Green Bay's neighborhoods well, from the historic areas downtown to suburban developments in Howard, and we take care of proper disposal while you focus on what matters - whether that's cheering on the Pack or managing your busy work schedule.</p> serviceAreasIntro: "We serve all of Green Bay metro, from Fox River waterfront communities to suburban neighborhoods, covering every ZIP code in Wisconsin's third-largest city and surrounding Brown County area." regulationsCompliance: "Brown County's disposal system creates confusion for residents - Green Bay city dwellers can use municipal garages, but folks in Allouez, Ashwaubenon, De Pere, and other surrounding communities must pay fees at the South Broadway transfer station. We eliminate this complexity entirely - no sorting out which drop-off site you're allowed to use, no fees, no driving across town with mattresses strapped to your vehicle during busy traffic periods." environmentalImpact: | <p>Green Bay built its identity around making things - from the paper mills that earned the "Toilet Paper Capital of the World" title to the manufacturing plants along the Fox River today. That industrial heritage means residents understand the value of processing materials properly rather than just throwing them away. Our recycling system breaks down each mattress into steel springs, foam, and fabric that get turned into new products.</p> <p>Each mattress we collect represents about 65 pounds of material that stays in the manufacturing cycle instead of heading to Wisconsin landfills. The steel becomes new metal products, foam gets processed into carpet padding, and fabrics support textile manufacturing - keeping the same circular approach that built Green Bay's economy in the first place.</p> <p>For environmentally conscious residents who appreciate Green Bay's manufacturing roots, our service provides a straightforward way to handle mattress disposal responsibly. You know your old mattress is getting the same careful processing that the city's paper and packaging industries have always provided - materials properly sorted, reused, and kept productive.</p> howItWorksScheduling: "We offer flexible scheduling that works around Green Bay's unique patterns - healthcare shifts at major medical centers, game day traffic near Lambeau, and Wisconsin's unpredictable winter weather." howItWorksService: "Our team comes prepared for Green Bay metro housing - from downtown lofts to suburban ranch homes, Fox River properties with unique access, and everything from new construction in Howard to vintage homes in the historic districts." howItWorksDisposal: "Your mattress goes to Wisconsin-approved processing facilities where materials get properly separated and recycled, following the same quality standards that Green Bay's manufacturing heritage demands." sidebarStats: mattressesRemoved: "2340" ---
