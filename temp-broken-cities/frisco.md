Over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide - book online in 60 seconds." aboutService: "A Bedder World delivers premium mattress removal throughout Sports City USA with specialized curbside pickup for Frisco's unique community. Our service handles luxury mattresses, bedroom sets, and furniture from single pieces to complete room makeovers - perfect for this fast-growing suburb where corporate relocations and master-planned community move-ins happen daily. We understand Frisco's exceptional demographics: corporate executives relocating to The Star district, international families moving to PGA Frisco areas, sports industry professionals upgrading luxury homes in Starwood and Stonebriar, and growing families in master-planned communities like The Grove, Fields, and Phillips Creek Ranch. Our licensed teams use professional equipment to handle high-end furniture with the care these premium developments expect, providing transparent pricing that matches this community's standards. Frisco's restrictive bulk pickup rules make our service essential - the city limits bulk items to just 5 pieces monthly, with strict 6-foot and 50-pound limits that exclude most standard mattresses. Instead of driving 20+ miles to Melissa landfill or waiting weeks for monthly pickup slots, our flexible scheduling works around corporate relocations, Dallas Cowboys event schedules, youth sports tournaments, and the busy lifestyles of active families throughout Sports City USA. We serve all of Frisco's diverse neighborhoods, from luxury gated communities to new apartment complexes, providing the reliable, professional service this Sports City USA community expects." serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress pickup throughout Frisco's master-planned communities, from luxury gated neighborhoods to corporate districts and sports venues:" regulationsCompliance: "Frisco residents face some of the most restrictive bulk pickup policies in North Texas, with monthly limits of just 5 items, maximum dimensions of 6 feet, and 50-pound weight restrictions that exclude most standard mattresses. The city requires advance online scheduling with lists closing at noon the day prior, and residents must transport oversized items to transfer stations in Plano (requiring water bill verification) or drive 20+ miles to the Melissa landfill. These limitations create significant challenges for corporate executives during relocations, families in luxury developments upgrading furniture, and sports industry professionals with demanding schedules. Our service eliminates these complications with next-day availability that works around corporate timelines, no size or weight restrictions for proper mattress disposal, professional pickup that respects master-planned community standards, and environmentally responsible recycling that aligns with Frisco's high community expectations." environmentalImpact: "Our Frisco service diverts 80% of mattress materials from regional landfills through certified North Texas recycling facilities. After serving luxury master-planned communities, corporate relocations, sports industry professionals, and growing families throughout Sports City USA, we've recycled 4,200 mattresses (168,000 pounds) supporting environmental conservation values that align with this premium community's sustainability expectations. This regional processing reduces transportation emissions while creating jobs that serve Frisco's diverse economy including professional sports, corporate headquarters, technology, and international business. Residents contribute to sustainability programs that reflect the environmental consciousness important to this educated community, supporting the conservation values that make Frisco one of Texas' premier sports and corporate hubs." howItWorksScheduling: "Corporate and family-friendly scheduling designed for Frisco's demanding lifestyles.
