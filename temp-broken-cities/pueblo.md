Total cost $185 exactly as quoted online." - author: Lisa R. neighborhood: University Area date: "2025-01-14" rating: 5 text: "Moving out of student housing near CSU Pueblo, needed quick mattress disposal before lease ended. Service was incredibly fast - booked Sunday night, pickup completed Tuesday morning. Team was respectful of property management requirements and left everything clean. Much better than trying to haul to RecycleWorks myself." - author: Roberto G. neighborhood: Southside date: "2025-01-09" rating: 5 text: "Replaced mattresses after our basement flooded last month.

Fair pricing, reliable service, would definitely use again." # FAQs faqs: - question: "How quickly can you schedule pickup in Pueblo?" answer: "We provide next-day service throughout Pueblo neighborhoods.

Our crews know local access routes and work around current I-25/US 50B construction zones affecting central corridors." - question: "Can you handle pickup from Victorian homes and older buildings?" answer: "Absolutely.
