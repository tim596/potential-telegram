Our 100% recycling commitment transforms these into valuable materials instead of DuPage County landfill waste.

Memory foam converts to carpet padding used throughout the region. Cotton batting transforms into insulation for Midwest homes. This material recovery creates green jobs while reducing environmental impact. University housing turnover and new construction boom amplify our positive effect. Every Elmhurst pickup joins our nationwide achievement of 1+ million mattresses diverted from landfills." howItWorksScheduling: "Online booking accommodates Elmhurst's busy professionals and student schedules.
