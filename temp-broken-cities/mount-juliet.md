Wilson County recycling centers have restricted mattress acceptance, requiring residents to rely on costly private junk removal services typically charging disposal fees for hazardous waste handling. Our professional service eliminates these coordination challenges and disposal fees entirely - no Wilson County facility restrictions, no private hauler scheduling conflicts, no hazardous waste disposal charges, and no transportation requirements. We provide immediate next-day pickup with transparent pricing, making us the superior choice for Mount Juliet residents who value convenience and reliability over complex waste provider coordination." nearbyCities: - name: "Nashville" distance: "17 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Lebanon" distance: "12 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Gallatin" distance: "25 miles" isSuburb: true reviews: count: 143 featured: - reviewer: "Jennifer L." rating: 5 text: "Called Monday morning and they picked up Tuesday afternoon exactly as scheduled.
