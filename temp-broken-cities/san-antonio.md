Our mattress recycling initiative has diverted 18,943 mattresses from Bexar County landfills, saving approximately 1,136 cubic yards of landfill space while recovering over 151 tons of materials. Steel springs support construction applications throughout the booming South Texas corridor, foam components become padding for various military and civilian projects, and textile materials gain new purpose through advanced processing. Each recycled mattress prevents 40 pounds of waste from entering local landfills, contributing to San Antonio's goal of reducing waste generation by 40% by 2030.
