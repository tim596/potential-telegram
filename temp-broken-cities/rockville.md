City of Rockville provides bulk waste collection by appointment only for residents within city limits, with items up to 499 pounds accepted. Maryland HB1355 establishes a Mattress Stewardship Program beginning January 1, 2029, which will prohibit landfill disposal and require producer-funded recycling programs. Current regulations allow private disposal services like ours, avoiding the appointment scheduling required by city services and the condition restrictions at county facilities. Our service eliminates the need to transport mattresses to the transfer station location on Frederick Road in Derwood, making disposal convenient for busy professionals and families throughout Montgomery County's rapidly growing communities from urban downtown to suburban master-planned neighborhoods." nearbyCities: - name: "Washington DC" distance: "20 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Alexandria" distance: "25 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Ashburn" distance: "22 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Bowie" distance: "35 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Centreville" distance: "18 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Chantilly" distance: "15 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Fairfax" distance: "18 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Gaithersburg" distance: "8 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Herndon" distance: "12 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Leesburg" distance: "25 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Manassas" distance: "25 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Reston" distance: "10 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Springfield" distance: "22 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Sterling" distance: "18 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Vienna" distance: "12 miles" isSuburb: true reviews: count: 247 featured: - reviewer: "Michael T." rating: 5 text: "Quick pickup for our townhouse.

Over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide. Licensed service for King Farm, Fallsgrove, and all Montgomery County neighborhoods. Book online today." aboutService: "Our professional mattress removal service delivers what Rockville's 68,000 residents need: efficient pickup that respects the sophisticated master-planned communities and accommodates the demanding schedules of federal employees and DC area professionals throughout Montgomery County. Whether you're a government contractor managing security clearance requirements, a biotech professional coordinating around NIH campus schedules, a family balancing children's activities in King Farm's walkable environment, or residents navigating master-planned community guidelines in Fallsgrove, we make mattress disposal straightforward with next-day pickup that works around your busy life. Montgomery County requires mattresses meet specific condition standards for recycling at the Shady Grove facility, and city bulk pickup requires advance appointments with weight restrictions that complicate disposal for busy families and professionals. Our service eliminates these county system limitations entirely - no appointment scheduling, no condition restrictions, no transport to Derwood facility, just professional pickup when your schedule allows. Each collected mattress flows through our proven national recycling network with 80% material recovery rates, supporting Maryland's upcoming 2029 mattress stewardship program and Montgomery County's environmental initiatives - professional service that honors both your valuable time and Rockville's unique identity as a premier planned community where federal employment meets innovative biotechnology growth in one of America's most educated metropolitan areas." serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress pickup serves all Rockville areas from master-planned King Farm to historic downtown, expertly coordinating with federal employee schedules, biotech campus requirements, master-planned community guidelines, and HOA protocols throughout Maryland's premier planned community hub. From walkable King Farm neighborhoods to transit-oriented Twinbrook developments, our operations understand the unique needs of Montgomery County's most sophisticated communities including federal contractor relocations, family moves between developments, townhouse renovations, and the practical disposal requirements of residents living where cutting-edge biotechnology meets government employment in the National Capital Region." environmentalImpact: "Environmental stewardship aligns with Rockville's commitment to planned community excellence and innovation as Montgomery County's biotechnology hub. Our Rockville operations have recycled 2,847 mattresses, saving approximately 85,410 cubic feet of Montgomery County landfill space while recovering over 256 tons of steel springs, 114 tons of foam, and 57 tons of textile materials for manufacturing reuse. Our mattress recycling initiative ensures 80% of collected materials avoid Maryland landfills, instead flowing into manufacturing processes that create new products while supporting Maryland's upcoming 2029 mattress stewardship program and landfill ban requirements. Steel springs become construction materials for Northern Virginia infrastructure projects, foam components transform into padding for various applications, and textile materials gain new purpose through advanced processing. This responsible approach complements Montgomery County's waste reduction goals, supports master-planned community environmental standards that maintain property values, and reinforces Rockville's role as both a National Institute of Health research hub and environmentally conscious community - perfectly balancing federal employment demands with biotechnology innovation while advancing circular economy principles throughout Maryland's most educated region." howItWorksScheduling: "Flexible scheduling respects Rockville's unique rhythm combining federal employment with biotechnology innovation, accommodating Metro Red Line commuter patterns, NIH campus schedules, master-planned community logistics, and professional requirements throughout Montgomery County's premier planned community environment." howItWorksService: "Licensed pickup teams understand Rockville's distinctive requirements from gated King Farm entries to downtown high-rise logistics, federal contractor security protocols, HOA coordination, and family scheduling, handling all Maryland disposal requirements with expertise tailored to both government employment demands and the sophisticated amenities of master-planned communities serving the National Capital Region's most educated workforce." howItWorksDisposal: "Each mattress connects to our nationwide recycling network's proven processing capabilities, where Maryland environmental standards and upcoming 2029 mattress stewardship program requirements guide component recovery through sustainable manufacturing partnerships that support Rockville's dual identity as both the National Institute of Health's research neighbor and Montgomery County's most successful master-planned community serving federal employees and biotechnology professionals." sidebarStats: mattressesRemoved: "2,847" ---
