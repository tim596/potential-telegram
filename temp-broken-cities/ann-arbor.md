Two mattresses from upstairs apartment - team worked around my finals schedule and handled everything professionally. Perfect service for busy students." - author: Dr. James M. neighborhood: Medical Campus Area text: "Residency match meant quick relocation from Ann Arbor. Needed same-day pickup for king mattress from faculty housing. Team accommodated urgent timeline and provided all documentation for security deposit return." - author: Amy C. neighborhood: Burns Park text: "Home renovation in this historic neighborhood. Crew was careful with our 1920s hardwood floors and narrow doorways. Appreciated their knowledge of older Ann Arbor homes and respectful approach." faqs: - question: "How quickly can you pick up mattresses during University of Michigan move-out season?" answer: "We prioritize student move-outs during peak seasons (May/June and August) with next-day service available. Same-day pickup often possible during urgent situations like lease violations or surprise housing changes." - question: "Do you service University of Michigan dormitories and student apartments?" answer: "Yes, we regularly service both on-campus housing and off-campus student apartments throughout Ann Arbor. We coordinate with UM housing services and private property management companies as needed." - question: "Can you help with medical residency housing moves at UM Medical Campus?" answer: "Absolutely. We understand the unique timing of medical resident housing transitions and can accommodate urgent timelines common during match season and rotation changes." - question: "What's included in your Ann Arbor mattress removal service?" answer: "Complete removal from any location (dorm rooms, apartment stairs, faculty housing), loading, transport to certified recycling facilities, and cleanup. We handle Washtenaw County disposal requirements and provide documentation." - question: "Do you work with Ann Arbor property management companies?" answer: "Yes, we partner with property managers throughout Ann Arbor's student housing market. We provide required disposal documentation and coordinate timing to meet lease requirements and security deposit terms." - question: "Can you remove mattresses from historic Ann Arbor homes?" answer: "Our team specializes in navigating Ann Arbor's diverse housing stock, from historic Old West Side homes with narrow staircases to modern student complexes. We handle Victorian-era homes, 1920s bungalows, and contemporary buildings." - question: "How do I schedule pickup during busy student move-out periods?" answer: "Book online or call 720-263-6094. We recommend scheduling 2-3 days in advance during peak periods (late April through June). We maintain expanded capacity specifically for Ann Arbor's academic calendar." - question: "Are you licensed for mattress disposal in Washtenaw County?" answer: "Yes, we maintain all required Michigan and Washtenaw County licenses for waste hauling and mattress disposal. We follow county bulky waste regulations and work with approved recycling facilities." localRegulations: "Washtenaw County classifies mattresses as bulky waste requiring special disposal through licensed facilities, with limited recycling options due to recent funding cuts to county-subsidized programs. The City of Ann Arbor provides seasonal drop-off services for students at 2000 S. Industrial Highway during peak move-out periods, but requires items to be broken down to fit in dumpsters. Our professional mattress removal service eliminates these challenges by providing complete pickup, proper transport in covered vehicles, and direct delivery to certified recycling facilities bypassing the county's limited drop-off system. We maintain all required Washtenaw County waste hauler licenses and provide disposal documentation that satisfies University of Michigan housing requirements, private property management guidelines, and security deposit protection. Unlike the seasonal drop-off system which operates limited hours during peak periods, our service operates year-round with flexible scheduling to accommodate academic calendars, medical residency match timelines, and faculty housing transitions throughout the Ann Arbor area." pageContent: heroDescription: "Professional mattress removal in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
