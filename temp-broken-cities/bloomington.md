From Oxborough townhomes to East Bloomington single-family houses, we provide fast, eco-friendly curbside pickup that keeps your old mattress out of Minnesota landfills. Simple scheduling, transparent pricing, done right." aboutService: "A Bedder World provides professional mattress removal and recycling services throughout Bloomington, Minnesota's fourth-largest city. Our experienced team handles pickup, transportation, and eco-friendly disposal for over 89,000 residents across this bustling suburban community spanning 38 square miles south of Minneapolis. We specialize in mattress recycling for Bloomington's diverse housing landscape: sprawling single-family subdivisions built in the 1950s-70s housing boom, modern townhome complexes near the Minnesota River, established apartment buildings serving Mall of America workers, and senior living facilities throughout the community. Bloomington presents unique service challenges that our team navigates expertly: coordinating around heavy Mall of America tourist traffic (40+ million annual visitors), working within HOA guidelines for planned communities like Oxborough and Valley West, managing pickup logistics during winter months with Bloomington's strict snow emergency parking, accessing properties along the Minnesota River Valley with steep terrain and narrow streets, and scheduling around business district peaks near the massive Southtown shopping corridor. Every mattress we collect supports Hennepin County's waste diversion goals through our certified recycling network, where steel springs become construction materials, foam transforms into carpet padding for Minnesota buildings, and cotton fiber supports regional textile manufacturing. From East Bloomington's established neighborhoods to West Bloomington's newer developments, we provide professional, environmentally responsible mattress removal services designed for suburban Twin Cities living." serviceAreasIntro: "Comprehensive mattress pickup throughout Bloomington and surrounding Hennepin County communities, serving Minnesota's Mall of America suburb across all neighborhoods from established East Bloomington to newer West Bloomington developments:" regulationsCompliance: "Full compliance with Bloomington city waste collection ordinances and Hennepin County disposal regulations, including coordination with homeowners associations and winter parking restrictions." environmentalImpact: "Bloomington mattress removal directly supports regional environmental goals through strategic partnerships with Minnesota recycling facilities. Our collaboration with nearby Second Chance Recycling in Minneapolis and Dem-Con Companies in Shakopee ensures Bloomington's discarded mattresses achieve maximum material recovery rates exceeding 85%. Steel springs from Bloomington mattresses are processed into rebar for Twin Cities construction projects, including recent Mall of America expansions. Foam components become carpet padding for Minnesota schools and office buildings, while cotton batting transforms into insulation helping improve energy efficiency in Bloomington's aging housing stock built during the post-war suburban boom. This circular economy approach reduces transportation costs and emissions by utilizing regional facilities within 20 miles of Bloomington. Our service complements the city's robust recycling programs including the Bloomington Recycling Center at 2300 West Old Shakopee Road, helping residents exceed Hennepin County's ambitious 90% waste diversion target. Every Bloomington mattress recycled prevents approximately 40 pounds of landfill waste while supporting local green jobs at processing facilities throughout the Twin Cities metro area." howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day appointments available throughout Bloomington.
