County no longer accepts mattresses with free trash disposal as of April 2024. Our professional service eliminates these scheduling restrictions and fees entirely - no Tuesday pickup timing, no $20 per mattress charges, no credit card requirements, and no convenience center visits. We provide immediate next-day pickup with transparent pricing, making us the superior choice for Franklin residents who value convenience and reliability over city timing constraints and county fees." nearbyCities: - name: "Nashville" distance: "21 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Brentwood" distance: "8 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Cool Springs" distance: "3 miles" isSuburb: true reviews: count: 141 featured: - reviewer: "Jessica M." rating: 5 text: "Called Monday and they picked up Tuesday afternoon.
