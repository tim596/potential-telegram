The new Transit Village around BART stations requires coordination with underground parking systems and construction activities. Rossmoor's 55+ gated community (9,200 residents) has specific access protocols and waste management restrictions. Many apartment complexes built in the 1970s have narrow stairwells and limited elevator access requiring specialized handling. BART modernization projects create temporary access restrictions in the downtown core. The city's affluent professional population generates predictable furniture turnover during career relocations.
