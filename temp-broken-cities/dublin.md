Our service integrates with Wednesday municipal collection schedules while maintaining comprehensive licensing for corporate facility coordination and Columbus metro convenience. Having recycled over 1 million mattresses nationwide, we provide documentation meeting Cardinal Health campus standards, luxury HOA requirements, and premium residential protocols, ensuring compliance during corporate relocations, Columbus commuter transitions, and the unique demands of serving Ohio's most affluent corporate community." environmentalImpact: "Through strategic partnerships with Columbus metro recycling facilities, our Dublin service transforms discarded mattresses into valuable regional resources while supporting the corporate community's environmental leadership and Irish heritage sustainability initiatives. Each mattress diverts 40 pounds of recoverable materials from Franklin County landfills, with steel components becoming infrastructure materials for Columbus metro construction projects and foam elements converted to insulation for both luxury residential development and corporate facility construction throughout central Ohio. Our regional processing network keeps Dublin mattresses within the Columbus metro ecosystem, minimizing transport emissions while creating sustainable jobs in the expanding green economy. This approach directly supports Cardinal Health's corporate sustainability goals and Dublin's environmental stewardship values while contributing to Ohio's circular economy leadership. Over the past 25 months, we've redirected 2,180 Dublin mattresses from waste streams, representing 87,200 pounds of materials channeled into productive Columbus metro applications. By maintaining local processing partnerships, we strengthen the regional circular economy while honoring Dublin's transformation into Ohio's premier corporate and cultural destination through sustainable material recovery practices that support both luxury living and corporate excellence." howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day pickup available with flexible scheduling for Columbus commuters, Fortune 500 employees, and luxury community residents.

The city prohibits mattress placement with regular Wednesday trash collection and requires proper containment for water-damaged items. Golf communities like Muirfield Village and Ballantrae have additional HOA restrictions regarding pickup timing and contractor approval, while corporate campuses require specialized documentation and security protocols.
