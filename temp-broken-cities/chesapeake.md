Professional removal service for Hampton Roads' largest city by land area. Over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide - serving Virginia's premier suburban community and military families." aboutService: "A Bedder World provides professional mattress removal service throughout Virginia's largest city by land area, eliminating the hassle of Chesapeake's restrictive SPSA transfer station system. While residents struggle with only 12 annual transfer station visits, weekend-only hours, and driving across 341 square miles to reach the single facility, our simple online booking offers next-day pickup anywhere in Chesapeake with no annual limits or extra fees. We serve every neighborhood from Greenbrier's modern developments to Deep Creek's established communities, from Western Branch's family areas to South Norfolk's historic districts, providing reliable service that coordinates around military PCS schedules and busy family lifestyles. With over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide, we deliver the professional, convenient service that matches the high standards expected by Hampton Roads' premier suburban community." serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress pickup throughout Chesapeake's six boroughs and diverse communities spanning 341 square miles:" regulationsCompliance: "Chesapeake's current waste disposal system creates significant challenges for residents. The SPSA transfer station limits each household to just 12 visits per year, charges $78 per ton (minimum $20), and operates weekend-only hours for residential use at the single Hollowell Lane facility. This means residents must drive across 341 square miles, provide proof of residency, and work around restrictive Tuesday-Friday closures. These limitations particularly impact Hampton Roads' military families managing PCS moves, growing families needing furniture upgrades, and dual-career households without time for cross-town trips. Military deployment schedules, suburban family logistics, and varying distances across six boroughs make the current system especially difficult for Chesapeake's 254,997 residents. Our service eliminates these hassles with next-day pickup anywhere in the city, no annual visit limits, flexible scheduling around military and civilian work demands, and door-to-door convenience that serves all neighborhoods equally with the efficiency expected by Hampton Roads' premier suburban community." environmentalImpact: "Our Chesapeake service diverts 85% of mattress materials from Hampton Roads landfills through certified Virginia recycling networks. We've recycled 28,700 mattresses (1,148,000 pounds) throughout Chesapeake's six boroughs, supporting the environmental responsibility valued by this educated suburban community. The recycling process separates steel springs for Norfolk Naval Shipyard operations, foam for furniture manufacturing serving military housing, and textiles for regional logistics companies. This local processing reduces transportation emissions while supporting Virginia's circular economy. Chesapeake residents appreciate our commitment to environmental stewardship, which aligns with the city's role protecting the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge and stewarding Virginia's extensive deepwater canal system. Our service helps maintain the balance between suburban growth and conservation of the waterways, wetlands, and protected areas that make Chesapeake a model for responsible development in Hampton Roads." howItWorksScheduling: "Military-and-family-friendly scheduling designed for Chesapeake's unique combination of Hampton Roads military community demands and high-quality suburban lifestyle expectations. We coordinate around PCS schedules, deployment timing, dual-career work demands, school schedules, and the service excellence standards expected by Virginia's premier suburban destination." howItWorksService: "Our team specializes in Chesapeake's distinctive combination of military community professionalism and suburban family values. We navigate the six-borough system expertly, handle military housing and civilian subdivision access seamlessly, coordinate around Hampton Roads traffic and base schedules professionally, serve waterfront properties and canal communities carefully, and deliver the quality service that honors both the high standards of military families and the suburban lifestyle expectations that make Chesapeake the Hampton Roads destination of choice for families seeking community excellence, safety, and quality of life." howItWorksDisposal: "Licensed transport to certified Virginia recycling facilities where materials support regional Hampton Roads sustainability programs and environmental standards that reflect both military community responsibility and the conservation leadership expected by residents who chose Virginia's largest city for its balance of suburban excellence and environmental stewardship. Steel springs and foam components contribute to the regional Virginia economy while supporting Chesapeake's role as Hampton Roads' premier family destination, maintaining the environmental accountability that helps this community earn recognition as Virginia's safest large city while preserving the natural resources and quality of life that make Chesapeake a model for suburban development that balances growth with conservation of the waterways, wetlands, and protected areas that define exceptional Hampton Roads living." sidebarStats: mattressesRemoved: "28700" faqs: - question: "How quickly can you remove my mattress in Chesapeake?" answer: "We provide next-day pickup throughout all six Chesapeake boroughs including Greenbrier, Deep Creek, Western Branch, South Norfolk, Pleasant Grove, and Washington.
