Two guys showed up right on time, wrapped up our queen mattress and old box spring, and had it out of our bedroom in minutes. No damage to walls or floors even with tight doorways. Super professional and the price was exactly what they quoted online." - author: "Bob T." neighborhood: "Belcher Road Corridor" rating: 5 text: "Easy online booking and great communication. They texted me the morning of pickup with their arrival window. Pulled right into my driveway, got the mattress from upstairs, and loaded it up fast. Way easier than trying to haul it to the dump myself. Will definitely use them again." - author: "Jennifer K." neighborhood: "Largo Central Park" rating: 5 text: "My condo has narrow hallways and they handled it like pros. One guy stayed with the truck while the other brought a dolly upstairs. They were careful with everything and cleaned up the few bits of debris that fell off the old mattress. Great service for the money." - author: "David L." neighborhood: "Highland Pines" rating: 5 text: "Needed two mattresses removed from my rental property between tenants.
