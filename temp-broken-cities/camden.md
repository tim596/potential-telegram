Booked same-day pickup!" - author: Michael "Big Mike" Torrino neighborhood: Whitman Park rating: 5 text: "Been in Camden forty-two years, seen this neighborhood go through everything - the rough times in the '90s, now all this waterfront development bringing young families back. When my wife passed last year, I finally had to get rid of that old king mattress we'd had since '85. These A Bedder World folks were respectful, didn't rush me when I got a little emotional talking about it. They handled everything real gentle-like, explained how they recycle all the materials instead of just dumping it in some landfill. Made me feel good knowing even that old mattress was gonna help somebody somehow. Fair price too - $135 total, no hidden fees like some of these other companies try to pull. Good people doing good work in a city that deserves good things happening to it again." - author: Jasmine R. neighborhood: East Camden rating: 5 text: "Nursing school at Rutgers keeps me busy, but when three roommates graduated and left their mattresses behind, I needed help fast. Online booking was super easy, they came next morning, removed all three mattresses plus two box springs. Professional crew, competitive pricing, and they actually explained their recycling process which was cool to learn about." faqs: - question: How quickly can you remove mattresses in Camden? answer: Next-day pickup available throughout Camden's 20+ neighborhoods from Cramer Hill to downtown waterfront.

Easy online booking in 60 seconds or call (720) 263-6094. Professional service for Cooper Hospital staff, Rutgers community, and waterfront residents. Eco-friendly recycling supporting Camden's Delaware River restoration efforts." aboutService: "Cooper University Hospital's 7,000+ employees work demanding 12-hour shifts across Camden's healthcare ecosystem. Our service adapts to medical professionals' complex schedules - early morning pickups before day shifts, late evening service after night rotations, and weekend availability that works around hospital coverage needs. From nurses in Cramer Hill's waterfront apartments to medical residents near Rutgers-Camden campus, we understand healthcare workers need reliable, flexible mattress removal that fits their unpredictable schedules. The Cooper-Rutgers medical education partnership brings constant housing transitions - medical students moving between rotations, residents finishing programs, nursing staff relocating closer to the 635-bed regional medical center. Our next-day service eliminates the stress of coordinating furniture removal around clinical responsibilities, while our certified recycling supports the environmental stewardship these institutions require from vendors." serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress removal serving every Camden neighborhood, from Delaware River waterfront to inland residential areas:" regulationsCompliance: "Camden County Environmental Affairs' Go Green Initiative Association received $1.2 million in federal EPA funding for recycling programs targeting lower-income communities - exactly what our certified service supports. While Camden's municipal pickup requires residents to wrap mattresses in plastic, limit to 3 bulk items per collection day, and coordinate around restricted scheduling windows, our comprehensive service handles all compliance automatically. Camden County's Environmental Affairs Division mandates proper documentation for the 30 tons of waste diverted from Delaware River annually, which our certified recycling process provides. Cooper University Hospital and Rutgers-Camden require environmental compliance certificates from service vendors - we provide complete disposal tracking that meets institutional sustainability standards. This eliminates coordination around hospital shifts, academic calendars, and Camden County's household hazardous waste collection events while ensuring your mattress materials support the county's broader recycling initiatives rather than burden the limited municipal system." environmentalImpact: "Our mattress recycling directly supports Camden's remarkable environmental transformation. The city invested $48 million through the NJ Office of Natural Resource Restoration to convert the Harrison Avenue Landfill into Cramer Hill Waterfront Park - 62 acres that now include 7 acres of tidal freshwater wetlands and a 2-acre fishing pond. By achieving 80% material recovery through certified recycling, we prevent mattress chemicals from entering the Delaware River system that the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority worked to restore by stopping 7 million gallons of daily raw sewage discharge. Our partnership with Republic Services and Waste Management ensures steel springs become construction materials for ongoing waterfront development, memory foam transforms into insulation for Cooper Hospital expansions, and fabric covers become industrial textiles supporting local manufacturing recovery. This keeps an estimated 65 pounds of toxic materials per mattress from potentially contaminating the restored wetlands and waterfront that residents, Cooper medical students, and 1.2 million annual Adventure Aquarium visitors now enjoy. Every Camden mattress we recycle contributes to the environmental justice transformation of historically polluted neighborhoods into the sustainable, healthy community that healthcare workers and families deserve." howItWorksScheduling: "Camden scheduling works around this city's unique rhythm - hospital shifts at Cooper University Hospital, academic calendars at Rutgers-Camden and Rowan medical school, commuter schedules across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge to Philadelphia, and major events at waterfront venues. Early morning pickups accommodate night shift healthcare workers. Evening appointments work for day shift medical staff. Weekend scheduling avoids concert and aquarium peak traffic times." howItWorksService: "Our Camden team combines waterfront city expertise with respect for this community's remarkable resilience. From Walt Whitman's preserved home to new corporate developments like Subaru headquarters, we provide professional service that honors both Camden's literary heritage and contemporary recovery. Every pickup protects your property and supports Camden's ongoing revitalization efforts." howItWorksDisposal: "Materials head to certified New Jersey recycling facilities via efficient routes that avoid peak bridge traffic and waterfront event congestion, ensuring timely processing while meeting state compliance requirements and contributing to our nationwide achievement of 1+ million mattresses recycled." sidebarStats: mattressesRemoved: "1,538" ---
