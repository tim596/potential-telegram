New construction communities like Friendship Station and Bella Casa must follow the Town's Unified Development Ordinance requirements for bulk item disposal, while established neighborhoods coordinate through Apex's twice-monthly bulk pickup schedule. Our professional mattress removal service eliminates the hassle of scheduling around municipal collection dates, navigating HOA restrictions, and meeting the Town's specific requirements for oversized item placement, providing Research Triangle Park professionals and new construction families the convenience that makes Apex living truly the Peak of Good Living." environmentalImpact: "Through established partnerships with Research Triangle-area recycling facilities, our Apex service transforms discarded mattresses into valuable regional resources while supporting the Peak of Good Living's environmental stewardship initiatives. Each mattress diverts 40 pounds of recoverable materials from Wake County landfills, with steel components becoming infrastructure materials for Triangle region construction projects and foam elements converted to insulation for both new Apex developments and Triangle-area construction supporting the region's rapid growth. Our regional processing network keeps Apex mattresses within the Research Triangle ecosystem, minimizing transport emissions while creating sustainable jobs in the region's expanding green economy. This approach directly supports the tech and healthcare community's sustainability values while contributing to the Triangle's environmental innovation leadership. Over the past 24 months, we've redirected 1,890 Apex mattresses from waste streams, representing 75,600 pounds of materials channeled into productive Triangle applications. By maintaining local processing partnerships, we strengthen the Research Triangle's circular economy while honoring Apex's commitment to responsible growth through sustainable material recovery practices that support both community development and environmental stewardship." howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day pickup available with flexible scheduling for Research Triangle families, tech professionals, and healthcare workers.
