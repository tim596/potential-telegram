Thurston County's Waste & Recovery Center accepts mattresses for disposal fees, but residents must transport mattresses themselves during facility hours (8am-4pm weekdays, 8am-4pm Saturdays, closed Sundays). Olympia's government workforce and professional community face unique challenges: state employees working legislative session schedules can't reach facilities during operating hours, families juggling work and community activities struggle with mattress transportation, and professionals prefer environmentally responsible disposal that reflects the capital city's environmental leadership values. Our professional service eliminates these barriers completely - no transportation required, no facility hour restrictions, no disposal fees, and environmentally responsible recycling that matches Olympia's commitment to sustainability. We handle all regulatory compliance, provide next-day pickup, and ensure proper recycling through our licensed network, making mattress disposal effortless for Olympia's government workers, professionals, and families." reviews: count: 289 featured: - reviewer: "Rachel S." rating: 5 text: "Work at the Department of Health - these guys worked around my state employee schedule perfectly.
