Weekly bulk pickup occurs between 7 AM and 7 PM on scheduled collection days, with items placed before 7 AM. Travis County residents can use Austin's Hazardous Waste Facility Monday-Friday 9 AM-5 PM, Saturday 7 AM-noon for specialized disposal. Our professional service eliminates these size and weight restrictions entirely - no 40-pound weight limits, no 48-inch length restrictions that exclude mattresses, no weekly placement timing requirements, and no coordination with Progressive Waste Solutions schedules. We provide immediate next-day pickup with transparent pricing, making us the superior choice for Pflugerville residents who value convenience over the city's restrictive municipal bulk waste system that technically can't handle most mattresses due to size limitations." nearbyCities: - name: "Austin" distance: "18 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Round Rock" distance: "8 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Cedar Park" distance: "20 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Georgetown" distance: "20 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Leander" distance: "25 miles" isSuburb: true reviews: count: 3,241 featured: - reviewer: "Jennifer R." rating: 5 text: "These guys were lifesavers!

Our Pflugerville operations have recycled 3,241 mattresses, saving approximately 97,230 cubic feet of Travis County landfill space while recovering over 291 tons of steel springs, 130 tons of foam, and 65 tons of textile materials for manufacturing reuse. Our mattress recycling initiative ensures 80% of collected materials avoid regional landfills, instead flowing into manufacturing processes that create new products while supporting Pflugerville's environmental leadership and community quality standards. Steel springs become construction materials for the city's continued growth, foam components transform into padding for various applications, and textile materials gain new purpose through advanced processing.
