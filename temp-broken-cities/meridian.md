Only non-recyclable remnants reach the landfill, dramatically reducing environmental impact compared to whole-mattress disposal." nearbyCities: - name: Boise distance: "11 miles" slug: "boise" isSuburb: false - name: Caldwell distance: "19 miles" slug: "caldwell" isSuburb: true - name: Nampa distance: "23 miles" slug: "nampa" isSuburb: true reviews: count: 267 featured: - author: "Rachel M." neighborhood: "Lochsa Falls" rating: 5 text: "Booked online Sunday night, team arrived Tuesday morning right on time.
