CSWD operates seven drop-off centers with varying acceptance policies - Burlington and Hinesburg centers exclude large items, requiring residents to navigate facility selection and transportation logistics for proper disposal. Municipal solid waste tax increases to $12/month per dwelling unit fund recycling services but create additional disposal complexities for University of Vermont's 17,000+ students during semester transitions, Church Street area residents upgrading apartments, and South End Arts District professionals managing workspace changes. Our streamlined mattress removal service eliminates these Chittenden County facility requirements entirely - no drop-off center coordination, no size restriction navigation, no facility selection complexity, and no municipal tax burden considerations. We provide convenient online booking with flexible pickup timing that accommodates Lake Champlain seasonal residents, university academic schedules, and Burlington's vibrant downtown lifestyle demands." nearbyCities: - name: "South Burlington" distance: "5 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Montpelier" distance: "35 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Rutland" distance: "65 miles" isSuburb: false reviews: count: 16 featured: - reviewer: "UVM_Senior" rating: 5 text: "Moving off-campus after graduation - needed old dorm mattress gone before lease ended.
