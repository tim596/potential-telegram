County customers access the I-66 Transfer Station or I-95 Landfill Complex (Mon-Fri 7am-5pm, weekends 7am-4pm) with $70 per ton disposal fees, $15 minimum charge, and Fairfax County residency verification. Private service customers coordinate directly with haulers, while county customers receive five annual special collections for bulk items. Virginia's 2028 Mattress Stewardship Program will require producer-funded recycling networks. Planned community residents juggling government contractor schedules, corporate headquarters demands, and family activities need flexible service that avoids facility hour restrictions, weekend limitations, and private hauler coordination complexities. Professional services eliminate transfer station trips, disposal fees, residency verification requirements, and scheduling conflicts that interfere with the demanding pace of Northern Virginia's premier planned community where convenience and time management are essential for busy professionals, growing families, and community-focused residents." reviews: count: 378 featured: - reviewer: "David M." rating: 5 text: "Working at General Dynamics means long project deadlines.

Each collected mattress flows through our proven national recycling network with 80% material recovery rates, supporting Virginia's upcoming 2028 Mattress Stewardship Program and the environmental stewardship values that define America's first modern planned community." serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress pickup serves all seven Reston villages from Reston Town Center's corporate hub to Lake Anne Village's historic charm, expertly coordinating with government contractor schedules, corporate headquarters timing, planned community protocols, and family activities throughout this thoughtfully designed community. From North Reston's wooded neighborhoods to South Reston's lakefront homes, our operations understand the unique requirements of planned community living including HOA coordination, community access protocols, professional schedules, and the practical disposal needs of residents living in Northern Virginia's most carefully planned and environmentally conscious community." environmentalImpact: "Environmental stewardship aligns perfectly with Reston's founding vision as America's first modern planned community, where sustainable living and community design have guided development since 1961. Our Reston operations have recycled 4,892 mattresses, saving approximately 146,760 cubic feet of Virginia landfill space while recovering over 439 tons of steel springs, 195 tons of foam, and 98 tons of textile materials for manufacturing reuse. Our mattress recycling initiative ensures 80% of collected materials avoid Virginia landfills, instead flowing into manufacturing processes that create new products while supporting the Commonwealth's new 2028 Mattress Stewardship Program. Steel springs become construction materials for continued community development, foam components transform into padding for various applications, and textile materials gain new purpose through advanced processing. This responsible approach complements Reston's 50% tree canopy coverage, 1,350 acres of preserved open space, and four pristine lakes, supporting the environmental leadership that has defined this planned community for over six decades - perfectly balancing professional success with environmental responsibility while advancing circular economy principles throughout Northern Virginia's most thoughtfully designed community." howItWorksScheduling: "Flexible scheduling respects Reston's unique rhythm combining government contractor deadlines with planned community living and family commitments, accommodating defense project schedules, corporate headquarters demands, community events, school activities, and the diverse needs of families and professionals throughout America's first modern planned community." howItWorksService: "Licensed pickup teams understand Reston's distinctive requirements from planned community access protocols to corporate campus logistics, government contractor security needs, HOA coordination, and multi-story townhouse complexes, handling all Virginia disposal requirements with expertise tailored to both Reston's professional identity and its role as home to families, government contractors, corporate executives, and community-focused residents across seven thoughtfully designed villages." howItWorksDisposal: "Each mattress connects to our nationwide recycling network's proven processing capabilities, where Virginia environmental standards and the upcoming 2028 Mattress Stewardship Program guide component recovery through sustainable manufacturing partnerships that support Reston's dual identity as both Northern Virginia's premier planned community and the region's government contractor hub serving professionals, families, and corporate employees across seven interconnected villages." sidebarStats: mattressesRemoved: "4,892" nearbyCities: - name: "Washington DC" distance: "24 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Alexandria" distance: "15 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Ashburn" distance: "12 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Bowie" distance: "38 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Centreville" distance: "18 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Chantilly" distance: "8 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Fairfax" distance: "10 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Gaithersburg" distance: "22 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Herndon" distance: "3 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Leesburg" distance: "18 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Manassas" distance: "22 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Rockville" distance: "27 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Springfield" distance: "18 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Sterling" distance: "10 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Vienna" distance: "12 miles" isSuburb: true ---
