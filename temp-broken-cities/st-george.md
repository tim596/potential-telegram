Washington County mandates that all loads be tarped or tied down ($10.77 penalty for unsecured loads), requires high-visibility safety vests for vehicle exit on working areas ($5.39 purchase required), and operates limited hours Monday-Tuesday and Friday-Saturday 7:00am-4:45pm, Sunday 7:00am-3:45pm (closed Wednesday-Thursday). Bulky furniture items qualify for no-charge disposal under the 2000-pound monthly resident allowance, but families upgrading bedrooms, retirees downsizing homes, and vacation property owners must coordinate personal transportation, navigate facility protocols, and plan around restricted operating schedules. Our comprehensive mattress removal service eliminates these Washington County facility requirements entirely - no Central Utah drives, no load securing mandates, no safety vest purchases, and no limited-hour scheduling conflicts. We provide convenient online booking with flexible pickup timing that accommodates retirement community schedules, tourism season demands, and family vacation property transitions throughout St. George's year-round active lifestyle." nearbyCities: - name: "Salt Lake City" distance: "300 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Provo" distance: "120 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Ogden" distance: "350 miles" isSuburb: false reviews: count: 23 featured: - reviewer: "RetiredCouple_AZ" rating: 5 text: "Moved here from Phoenix last year for retirement.
