Wood County residents can access Northwestern Landfill (first Saturday of each month is Free Day), but Parkersburg's riverfront location creates unique challenges: aging housing stock from 1940s industrial boom requires careful navigation of narrow river-bluff staircases, industrial shift workers need flexible scheduling around chemical plant rotations, seasonal flooding near Ohio River confluence affects pickup access, older multi-story homes lack elevator access requiring manual stair navigation, and former DuPont employee households often involve estate cleanouts with multiple large items. Our service handles these river community logistics professionally - coordinating around flood patterns, managing steep terrain access, and scheduling around industrial work schedules that define Parkersburg's character." reviews: count: 198 featured: - reviewer: "Mike T." rating: 5 text: "Had to clear out my dad's place after he retired from the chemical plant. Three flights up in one of those old riverfront houses - these guys handled the steep stairs like pros. Scheduling worked around my shift at the plant too." neighborhood: "Riverside" - reviewer: "Susan K." rating: 5 text: "Moving from Washington Bottom before flood season.
