I have to admit I was skeptical at first because I've had mixed experiences with service companies in the past, but let me tell you, this was different. The whole process was incredibly smooth from start to finish. When I called, they explained everything clearly - the pricing, the timing, what to expect. The team that came out was not only punctual but also really professional. They managed to get my old mattress out of my second-floor apartment without any drama, which I was worried about given how narrow our stairwell is. What really impressed me though was how they handled everything with care, making sure not to damage any walls or railings on the way out. I've already recommended them to my neighbor who's dealing with the same issue. Honestly, if you're on the fence about using this service, don't be - they know what they're doing and they do it well." author: "Jessica T." neighborhood: "Franklin Village" - text: "5-star service." author: "Carlos" neighborhood: "University District" faqs: - question: "Do you guarantee 100% recycling for every Southfield mattress?" answer: "Yes!
