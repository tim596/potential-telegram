Edmonds residents use three private waste hauling companies including Sound Disposal for downtown Bowl area service. Washington State lacks extended producer responsibility legislation for mattresses, making private removal services essential. Our service eliminates transfer station trips, Sound Disposal scheduling delays, and county facility limitations, providing convenient pickup for waterfront residents and Bowl area families managing ferry commuter schedules and tourist season logistics throughout Snohomish County's premier coastal community." nearbyCities: - name: "Seattle" distance: "15 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Bellevue" distance: "20 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Auburn" distance: "35 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Bothell" distance: "18 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Burien" distance: "28 miles" isSuburb: true reviews: count: 189 featured: - reviewer: "Mark T." rating: 5 text: "Scheduled pickup for our third-floor condo near the ferry terminal.
