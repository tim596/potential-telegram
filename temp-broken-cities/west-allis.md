With over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide, we bring reliable service to Milwaukee's historic working-class community." aboutService: | <p>West Allis residents know the value of straightforward service at fair prices. When your old mattress needs to go, we handle the heavy lifting so you don't have to deal with city bulk pickup scheduling or loading it into your truck. Our nationwide experience recycling over 1 million mattresses brings proven results to your doorstep, whether you live in one of the classic post-war homes near Jackson Park or a newer place in Rolling Green.</p> <p>People call us when they're replacing worn-out beds, moving between apartments, or clearing space after the kids move out. We work around shift schedules and family routines, understanding that West Allis folks appreciate honest service without the runaround. Our team navigates the grid streets easily and knows how to handle the narrow stairs and doorways common in homes built back when Allis-Chalmers was still the big employer in town.</p> <p>Instead of wrestling with city sanitation requirements or waiting weeks for bulk pickup, we come directly to you. Our service works around State Fair season traffic, handles everything from ground floor apartments to two-story homes, and takes care of proper disposal while you focus on work and family priorities.</p> serviceAreasIntro: "We serve all West Allis neighborhoods, from Fair Park near the State Fairgrounds to River Bend along the Root River, covering every grid street and cul-de-sac in this historic Milwaukee suburb." regulationsCompliance: "West Allis requires mattresses to be handled separately from regular garbage collection, with specific provider approval needed for dumpster disposal. The city's sanitation division manages weekly pickup but doesn't include bulky items. We eliminate the paperwork and scheduling hassles - no dealing with city offices, no waiting for bulk pickup appointments, no transporting mattresses yourself." environmentalImpact: | <p>West Allis has a long manufacturing heritage, and residents understand the value of keeping usable materials in the system rather than sending them to waste. Our recycling process breaks down each mattress into steel springs, foam padding, and fabric - materials that get turned into new products rather than taking up space in Wisconsin landfills.</p> <p>Each mattress we process diverts about 65 pounds of material from the waste stream. The steel springs become new metal products, foam gets processed into carpet padding, and fabric fibers support manufacturing. For a community that built its identity around making things, that circular approach makes sense.</p> <p>For families who care about doing the right thing, our service provides a practical way to handle mattress disposal responsibly. You know your old mattress is getting processed properly through established recycling channels instead of just ending up in a landfill somewhere.</p> howItWorksScheduling: "We offer flexible scheduling that fits your routine - early morning before work shifts, afternoon pickup while kids are at school, or weekend service when it's convenient for your family." howItWorksService: "Our team comes prepared for West Allis housing - from post-war single-family homes with narrow stairs to apartment buildings and condos throughout the neighborhoods. We handle the lifting and maneuvering safely and efficiently." howItWorksDisposal: "Your mattress goes to Wisconsin-approved processing facilities where materials get properly separated and recycled.
