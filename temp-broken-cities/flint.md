Called these folks and they had someone out the next day. The two guys who showed up were really cool - they explained their whole recycling process while they worked. Apparently the springs get melted down and turned into new steel, which is pretty wild when you think about it. They handled the narrow stairway like pros and had it wrapped up and out of there in no time. $155 total, no hidden fees or anything sketchy." - author: "Patricia W." neighborhood: "Mott Park" text: "Outstanding service!
