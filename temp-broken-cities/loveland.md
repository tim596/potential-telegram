Our rental had this disgusting mattress left behind by the previous tenant - it was one of those situations where you don't even want to touch the thing, you know? Two guys showed up with all the right equipment, wrapped it up professionally, and navigated our tricky staircase without a single scratch on the walls. I've already booked them for three more properties this month." rating: 5 - author: "Brian K." neighborhood: "Thompson Valley" text: "Called around to a bunch of places and these guys had the best price.
