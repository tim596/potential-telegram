With Walmart's first store opening here in 1962, the city has grown into a sophisticated corporate community housing executives, suppliers, and the extensive business ecosystem that supports three Fortune 500 companies. This unique position means our service area extends throughout the integrated Northwest Arkansas business region. ### Arkansas Environmental Responsibility Arkansas's commitment to responsible waste management means mattresses cannot simply be discarded with regular trash. The state's regulations require proper disposal through approved facilities, and Benton County has specific requirements for bulky items. Our service ensures full compliance while supporting the environmental consciousness growing throughout Northwest Arkansas's corporate community and the broader regional business ecosystem. ## Service Areas Throughout Rogers Our comprehensive coverage spans all of Rogers's diverse neighborhoods, from the corporate housing complexes of Pinnacle Hills to the historic downtown district where Arkansas's retail revolution began. We understand the unique characteristics of each area and adapt our service to meet the needs of both the corporate community and long-established families. ### Pinnacle Hills Corporate District Pinnacle Hills represents Rogers's modern corporate identity, featuring upscale developments, corporate housing, and the Pinnacle Hills Promenade shopping center. This area houses many of the executives and professionals who work throughout Northwest Arkansas's business community. Our team regularly services this area, understanding the high standards and convenience expectations of corporate professionals. ### Historic Downtown Rogers Downtown Rogers preserves the city's heritage as the birthplace of Walmart, featuring historic buildings, the Railyard District, and new developments like First Street Flats. This area requires specialized handling due to older building structures and historic preservation considerations, while accommodating the modern professionals who choose downtown living for its character and convenience. ### Established Residential Neighborhoods Areas like Eagle Crest, Eagle Glen, and Cambridge Park represent Rogers's family-focused residential communities. These neighborhoods house both corporate professionals and long-term residents who have built their lives around the city's transformation from a small railroad town to America's retail capital. ### New Development Areas Rogers continues expanding with new corporate housing and family developments throughout Benton County.

Our service fills this gap with responsive, professional pickup on your schedule. ### Corporate Housing Considerations Rogers's corporate housing complexes and upscale developments often have specific requirements for large item removal. Gated communities may have access protocols, while high-end developments maintain aesthetic standards for removal operations.
