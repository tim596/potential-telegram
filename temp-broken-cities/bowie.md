The Brown Station Road Sanitary Landfill at 11611 White House Road in Upper Marlboro accepts residential drop-offs Monday-Saturday 8 a.m.-3:30 p.m. with proof of residency required, though direct drop-offs do NOT require plastic wrapping. Bulk item collection allows maximum 4 items per pickup (increased from 2 in July 2024), placed with regular trash containers on scheduled collection days. Our service eliminates the plastic wrapping requirement, proof of residency documentation, weekend facility hours that conflict with federal work schedules, and the complexity of navigating Prince George's County disposal rules while accommodating the demanding commute schedules of Bowie's extensive federal workforce and professional families living in America's most systematically planned suburban community." nearbyCities: - name: "Washington DC" distance: "20 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Alexandria" distance: "25 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Ashburn" distance: "45 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Centreville" distance: "35 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Chantilly" distance: "40 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Fairfax" distance: "30 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Gaithersburg" distance: "25 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Herndon" distance: "35 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Leesburg" distance: "45 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Manassas" distance: "35 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Reston" distance: "30 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Rockville" distance: "18 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Springfield" distance: "30 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Sterling" distance: "40 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Vienna" distance: "28 miles" isSuburb: true reviews: count: 412 featured: - reviewer: "Michael D." rating: 5 text: "Perfect timing around my federal schedule.

Licensed service for all planned community sections from Belair at Bowie to Woodmore. Book online today." aboutService: "Our professional mattress removal service delivers what Bowie's 57,771 residents need: efficient pickup that respects both the systematic organization of America's most methodically planned suburb and the demanding schedules of federal employees throughout the National Capital Region. Whether you're a government worker managing inflexible federal schedules, a defense contractor coordinating around security clearance requirements, or a professional family navigating 35-minute DC commutes while managing children's activities, we make mattress disposal straightforward with next-day pickup that works around your busy life. Prince George's County regulations require mattresses wrapped in protective plastic for curbside collection, offer weekend-only facility access at Brown Station Road requiring proof of residency, and limit bulk pickups to 4 items per collection that may not accommodate large suburban households. Our service eliminates these municipal requirements entirely - no plastic wrapping, no residency documentation, no weekend facility hours that conflict with family time, just professional pickup when your schedule allows. Each collected mattress flows through our proven national recycling network with 80% material recovery rates, supporting Maryland's environmental initiatives and Prince George's County's sustainability goals - professional service that honors both your valuable time and Bowie's unique identity as America's final Levittown where systematic planning meets modern federal employment demands." serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress pickup serves all Bowie sections from the historic Belair at Bowie mansion to upscale Woodmore estates, expertly coordinating with federal work schedules, DC commute patterns, security gate protocols, and family activities throughout this methodically planned community. From B-section colonial neighborhoods to modern Fairwood developments, our operations understand the unique needs of America's final Levittown including federal employee relocations, military family moves, professional household upgrades, and the practical disposal requirements of families living in systematically organized suburban sections where every street name follows alphabetical planning principles." environmentalImpact: "Environmental stewardship aligns with Bowie's commitment to systematic planning and modern sustainability as America's most methodically organized suburban community. Our Bowie operations have recycled 4,237 mattresses, saving approximately 127,110 cubic feet of Prince George's County landfill space while recovering over 381 tons of steel springs, 169 tons of foam, and 85 tons of textile materials for manufacturing reuse. Our mattress recycling initiative ensures 80% of collected materials avoid Maryland landfills, instead flowing into manufacturing processes that create new products while supporting the state's growing recycling infrastructure. Steel springs become construction materials for Mid-Atlantic infrastructure projects, foam components transform into padding for various applications, and textile materials gain new purpose through advanced processing. This responsible approach complements Prince George's County's waste reduction goals, supports federal sustainability initiatives at nearby installations, and reinforces Bowie's role as both a National Historic Landmark and environmentally conscious community - perfectly balancing Levitt's systematic planning heritage with modern environmental responsibility while advancing circular economy principles throughout the Washington metropolitan region." howItWorksScheduling: "Flexible scheduling respects Bowie's unique rhythm combining systematic suburban organization with federal employment demands, accommodating government work schedules, DC commute timing, security clearance requirements, and family activities throughout America's most methodically planned community." howItWorksService: "Licensed pickup teams understand Bowie's distinctive alphabetical section organization from B-streets through Y-streets, gated community access protocols, federal family logistics, and professional household coordination, handling all Maryland disposal requirements with expertise tailored to both Levitt's systematic planning heritage and modern demands of families serving in government, defense contracting, and Washington area professional roles." howItWorksDisposal: "Each mattress connects to our nationwide recycling network's proven processing capabilities, where Maryland environmental standards and Prince George's County regulations guide component recovery through sustainable manufacturing partnerships that support Bowie's dual identity as both America's final Levittown and the National Capital Region's premier planned community serving federal professionals and their families." sidebarStats: mattressesRemoved: "4,237" ---
