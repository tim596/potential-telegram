County residents access the I-66 Transfer Station (Mon-Fri 7am-5pm, weekends 7am-4pm) or West Ox Road facility with residency verification. Private customers coordinate directly with haulers like American Disposal, with mattresses prohibited from regular dumpsters (fines apply). Fairfax County provides five annual special collections for bulk items. Virginia's 2028 Mattress Stewardship Program will mandate producer-funded recycling networks. Tech corridor professionals working round-the-clock shifts at data centers and corporate campuses need flexible service that avoids facility hour restrictions, weekend limitations, and private hauler coordination complexities. Our professional service eliminates these barriers, providing convenient pickup that accommodates international professionals' busy schedules, young families' needs, and the demanding pace of Dulles Technology Corridor employment where Herndon serves as home base for Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and major defense contractors." reviews: count: 289 featured: - reviewer: "Sarah K." rating: 5 text: "Working at AWS means unpredictable schedules.

Our Herndon operations have recycled 3,756 mattresses, saving approximately 112,680 cubic feet of Virginia landfill space while recovering over 337 tons of steel springs, 150 tons of foam, and 75 tons of textile materials for manufacturing reuse. Our mattress recycling initiative ensures 80% of collected materials avoid Virginia landfills, instead flowing into manufacturing processes that create new products while supporting the Commonwealth's new 2028 Mattress Stewardship Program. Steel springs become construction materials for the region's expanding data center infrastructure, foam components transform into padding for various applications, and textile materials gain new purpose through advanced processing. This responsible approach complements major corporations' sustainability commitments, supports the tech corridor's environmental initiatives, and reinforces Herndon's role as both the global data center capital and a forward-thinking community - perfectly balancing technological innovation with environmental responsibility while advancing circular economy principles throughout the world's most concentrated technology infrastructure hub." howItWorksScheduling: "Flexible scheduling respects Herndon's unique rhythm combining global data center operations with diverse family life and corporate demands, accommodating AWS shift patterns, defense contractor schedules, professional timelines, corporate relocation needs, and the varied requirements of families and professionals throughout the Dulles Technology Corridor's diverse community." howItWorksService: "Licensed pickup teams understand Herndon's distinctive access requirements from Historic Downtown's narrow streets to corporate campus logistics, data center security protocols, family coordination needs, and multi-story apartment complexes, handling all Virginia disposal requirements with expertise tailored to both Herndon's tech corridor identity and its role as home to professionals, young families, corporate employees, and technology specialists from around the world." howItWorksDisposal: "Each mattress connects to our nationwide recycling network's proven processing capabilities, where Virginia environmental standards and the upcoming 2028 Mattress Stewardship Program guide component recovery through sustainable manufacturing partnerships that support Herndon's dual identity as both the global data center capital and Northern Virginia's diverse tech community serving professionals, families, and corporate campus employees." sidebarStats: mattressesRemoved: "3,756" nearbyCities: - name: "Washington DC" distance: "22 miles" isSuburb: false - name: "Alexandria" distance: "18 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Ashburn" distance: "10 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Bowie" distance: "40 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Centreville" distance: "15 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Chantilly" distance: "5 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Fairfax" distance: "8 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Gaithersburg" distance: "20 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Leesburg" distance: "15 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Manassas" distance: "20 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Reston" distance: "3 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Rockville" distance: "25 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Springfield" distance: "15 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Sterling" distance: "7 miles" isSuburb: true - name: "Vienna" distance: "10 miles" isSuburb: true ---
