# How to Get Rid of a Mattress in San Francisco (7 Local Options)

![](/images/blog/san-francisco-skyline.jpeg)

In this post we will cover 7 local options for getting rid of an old mattress in the San Francisco Bay area. Mattresses are hard things to get rid of and the available options continue to become more expensive and harder to find.

AND If you want to recycle or responsibly dispose of your old mattress it can be even more of a nightmare.

You can’t simply take it on the cable car and if you don’t have a truck to load it into, what do you do with it? Luckily we have included some great options for you to take advantage of in the San Francisco area.

_IMPORTANT NOTE: Mattresses are large items that don’t compress and take up valuable space in garbage dumps. Many landfills across the nation are no longer accepting mattresses and most [donation](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) centers no longer accept them._

ByeBye Mattress is a directory with a list of mattress recycling centers throughout California that allow for you to drop off mattresses.

## Option #5: Donate Your Mattress

Donating your mattress is a great way to repurpose it and a way to let someone get some more use out of your gently used bed. You can also perhaps get a tax break! IRS form 8283.

Generally we have found that donation centers will not accept mattresses that have stains, rips, bed bugs or mattresses older than 5 years of age. _(Unfortunately, due to recent increased sanitary concerns, most donation centers are not accepting mattresses of any kind at this time. This is also true with the following locations in San Francisco):_

### [ARC of San Francisco](https://www.thearcsf.org/how-to-help/household-recycling.html)

1500 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94103  (415) 255-7200. ARC has partnered with the Community Thrift Store. (Not taking mattresses at this time)

### [Goodwill San Francisco Bay](https://sfgoodwill.org/donate/donate-goods/)

## Option #6: Sell it ([San Francisco's Craigslist](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/) Page or Facebook Marketplace)

![craigslist-logo-mattress-disposal](/images/blog/635925127643002128-a-copy-1024x579.jpg)

New mattresses are expensive these days. Believe it or not many people would love to purchase your lightly used mattress for a discounted price. As long as your mattress is stain free and not TOO old you may have some luck [selling](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/) or giving away your mattress on Craigslist or Facebook marketplace.

_SELLING TIPS: Be sure to take nice pictures. Let customers know how old your mattress is and that the mattress is bed bug free, stain free, etc..._

## Option #7: DIY - [Do it Yourself Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

Do what we do - Tear apart your mattress with a carpet knife and separate the materials, and then use the materials for other things. You can use the foam to make pillows, or dog beds, or you can take the foam to a carpeting manufacturer. Manufacturers use the foam to make carpeting underlayment. You can take the steel to your local recycling center. Cut up the wood from your boxspring and use it for firewood. We have a great step-by-step [“How To Guide”](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/) on our blog that you can follow.
