## Option #2: Donate It to [Brighter Tomorrows](https://www.brightertomorrows.net/)

![brighter-tomorrows-grand-prairie-donation-center](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2023-03-15-at-11.48.36-AM-1024x318.png)

Brighter Tomorrows Grand Prairie accepts a wide range of unwanted items for donation, including clothing, household goods, appliances, and furniture.

This is a great option if your mattress is still in good condition. You’ll need to double-check your mattress to make sure that it doesn’t have any stains or tears. It needs to be clean too (no pet hair), and ideally no older than five years old.

[Brighter Tomorrows](https://www.brightertomorrows.net/) is located at 401 W Marshall Dr, Grand Prairie. So you can deliver your mattress yourself if you’re able to lift and transport the mattress to their address, which is open Tuesday to Saturday, 9am to 4pm.

If not, you’ll be glad to know that they offer pickup services. This might come at a cost.

## Option #3: Drop at [The Grand Prairie Landfill](https://www.gptx.org/Departments/Solid-Waste/Landfill)

![grand-prairie-texas-logo](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2023-03-15-at-11.53.19-AM.png)

While not the most environmentally friendly, the local [Grand Prairie Landfill](https://www.gptx.org/Departments/Solid-Waste/Landfill) is another option that’s worth mentioning here if you need to get rid of your mattress and are unable to recycle or donate it.

The Grand Prairie Landfill is located at 1102 MacArthur Blvd in Grand Prairie. This local landfill service accepts household and commercial waste, as long as it’s not batteries, liquids, tires, used oil filters, or pesticides.

So mattresses are accepted. There are fees to drop off your items, though, priced at $40 per ton. As for the operating hours, these are 7:30am to 4:30pm from Monday to Saturday.

Of course, you will need a means to lift and transport the mattress yourself with this method.

## Option #4: Sell It On [Craigslist](https://dallas.craigslist.org/location/grand-prairie-tx) Or Facebook Marketplace

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is relatively new and in good condition, you might want to consider selling it instead of disposing of it. 

This is worth trying if you need some extra cash and are not in a rush to get rid of your mattress. It’s also a great way to let someone else get some use out of it and reduce environmental waste.

Popular sites like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace make it easy to [sell your mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/) online.

Similar to donating a mattress, you’ll want to make sure your mattress doesn’t have any stains or damage. If it does, it’s a good idea to detail them in your listing, if they are minor, to ensure that buyers know what they are getting.

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![man-tearing-open-an-old-mattress](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-1024x572.webp)

Last but not least: DIY mattress recycling. Provided you have an exacto knife and enough space to get work, it’s more than possible to break down your mattress yourself and recycle the majority of the materials inside.

This mostly involves removing the cover on all sides before separating the materials, which mostly comprise of foam, fabric, and steel.

METAL - The metal can be dropped at a local scrap metal yard where they will weigh it and likely give you a small amount of cash. [https://www.armetalrecyclers.com/Grand\_Prairie,\_Texas.html](https://www.armetalrecyclers.com/Grand_Prairie,_Texas.html)

FOAM - You can take the foam to a local carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. Be sure to call first as not all carpet manufacturers accept foam from the public.

FABRIC - The fabric can be thrown in your standard trash bin or you can look around for fabric repurpose/recycling centers.
