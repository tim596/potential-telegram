Luckily, we have researched various options for you to get rid of a mattress here in Las Vegas and have compiled a list below. We have included options for you to sell it, [donate](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) it, dispose of it, or recycle it (which is what we do!).

![landfill-las-vegas](/images/blog/WE_WastePile.jpeg)

You are lucky to have the largest landfill in North America just 25 miles outside of Las Vegas. The Apex landfill is a  
model for the rest of the country and is [doing wonderful things with trash](https://swana.org/news/newsletters/article/april-22-2021/pbs-overview-airs-apex-landfill-episode) to generate energy to power Las Vegas.  
If you have a truck, and a friend to help, you can load up your mattress and take it to the dump. Be sure to call first  
to check hours of operation and check on the fees to dump a mattress.  

Landfill option #1 - [Apex Regional Landfill](https://wastebits.com/locator/location/apex-regional-landfill)

## Option #3: Good Condition? Try To Donate it

![local-mattress-donation](/images/blog/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

Donating your lightly used mattress to someone in need is a great option! Family members or friends are often potential recipients. You can also check with your favorite charity, church, or community center. Donation centers will sometimes take mattresses if they are in good shape, free of stains, and are 5 years old or under.

\*\* **We checked with the following donations centers [Salvation Army](https://www.salvationarmysouthernnevada.org/), [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.lasvegashabitat.org/), and [Goodwill](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) in Las Vegas and unfortunately, due to sanitary concerns and bed bug concerns, none are accepting mattresses for donation at this time.**

## Option #4: Sell it - [Las Vegas Craigslist](https://lasvegas.craigslist.org/) or FaceBook Marketplace

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

New Mattresses can be [quite expensive](https://www.abedderworld.com/most-expensive-mattresses.html/), so there are many people who may not have the resources to buy a new mattress. A gently used mattress without tears, stains, or bed bugs could be a welcome item for them. Make sure you take a nice picture of your mattress and [state clearly that it doesn’t have stains](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/) or bed bugs. Maybe you can make a little extra cash and help someone else save a buck.

## Option #5: DIY - [Do it Yourself Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![inside-the-birch-mattress](/images/blog/IMG_4265-2-768x1024.jpeg)

Do what we do - Tear apart your mattress with a carpet knife and separate the materials, and then use the  
materials for other things. You can use the foam to make pillows, or dog beds, or you can take the foam to a carpeting manufacturer. Manufacturers use the foam to make carpeting underlayment. You can take the steel to your local recycling center. Cut up the wood from your boxspring and use it for firewood.  
We have a great step-by-step [“How To Guide”](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/) on our blog that you can follow.
