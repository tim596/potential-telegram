IMPORTANT: You mattress must be in nice condition and lightly used to be donated. This donation center will NOT accept mattresses that are older, have stains or rips or are not structurally sound.

For residents of Utah looking to give their still-useable mattress a second life, donation is an excellent option. One notable platform is AdoptABed.org.

AdoptABed.org is a non-profit organization that facilitates the donation of mattresses in good condition to those in need. It's an opportunity to both free up space in your home and make a difference in someone else's life.

Before considering this option, it's important to assess the condition of your mattress. AdoptABed.org only accepts mattresses that are still in good condition—this means no major stains, rips, or structural issues. If your mattress meets these criteria, you can schedule a pickup directly from your home, making it a convenient option for mattress disposal.

Keep in mind that donation not only helps others but also reduces the environmental impact of waste. It's a win-win solution.

If your mattress is in decent shape and has no tears or stains, then it’s probably still in good enough condition to be reused. So - why not try selling or giving it away online to see if you can get some cash for it or at least save the cash that you will have to pay for disposal.

There are a lot of great platforms you can use to sell your old mattress but some of the most popular are [Craigslist](https://peoria.craigslist.org/), [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), and [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/113848465291957/).

Recycling a mattress can be a bit of a project, but if you're willing to put in the time and effort, it's definitely doable and very beneficial for the environment. Here's a step-by-step guide to recycling a mattress yourself and where to take the components in Salt Lake City:

**Step 1: Dismantle the Mattress** Start by removing the outer fabric of the mattress. This typically involves cutting around the perimeter of the mattress and peeling back the fabric. Underneath, you'll find several layers of materials, including foam, cotton, and potentially a layer of metal springs.

**Step 2: Separate the Materials** Once you've exposed the inside of the mattress, begin separating the different types of materials. Be sure to keep them in separate piles for easier disposal.

**Step 3: Recycle the Metal** If your mattress has a layer of metal springs, these can often be recycled at scrap metal facilities. In Salt Lake City, Western Metals Recycling or Metro Group, Inc. are two places where you can take scrap metal.

**Step 4: Recycle the Foam** The foam found in mattresses can often be recycled and used for carpet padding or other similar uses. Some places may accept foam for recycling, but you may need to contact local recycling facilities to confirm.

**Step 5: Recycle the Wood** If your mattress had a box spring made of wood, this can usually be recycled or repurposed as well. Salt Lake Valley Landfill's Green Waste Recycling Program accepts untreated wood.

**Step 6: Dispose of the Fabric** The outer fabric of the mattress can typically be recycled as well. However, it's important to check the material type and clean it thoroughly before taking it to a textile recycling facility.

Remember, recycling a mattress is a great way to help reduce landfill waste. However, it can be labor-intensive and not all components may be accepted for recycling. Always check with local facilities to confirm what materials they accept before starting the process.

## To Wrap Up

While an old mattress certainly is a hard item to dispose of, getting rid of it in the Salt Lake is actually much easier than most cities in country.

The metal springs for example will be melted down and recycled, while the foam can bed shredded and made into carpet padding.

### **How Can I Tell If My Mattress Has Broken?**

If you feel like your mattress has been worn out, but you aren’t sure whether it’s time for a replacement, the most important place to look is actually on the surface rather than checking the interior. 

Look for any dip or sags that could indicate the structure and support of the mattress is breaking down. Also, analyze how you feel while sleeping on your mattress and if it is providing you enough support.
