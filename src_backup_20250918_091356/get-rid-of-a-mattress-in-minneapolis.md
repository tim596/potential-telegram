This company is not only great because of the mattress recycling that it provides. It is also great because of the employment opportunities that it gives to the community.

Have a mattress in decent condition that someone could still use? There is a large market of people in Minneapolis and around the country looking for used mattresses rather than having to spend hundreds or thousands on a new one.

If your mattress is free from stains and bed bugs you will likely be able to give it away or sell it and get some cash for it.

We recommend taking nice clean pictures and ensuring potential buyers that there are no stains or bed bugs present.

Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

If you feel like taking on a project and being eco-friendly you can recycle your mattress yourself.

To do this you will want to cut off the cover and separate the metal and foam layers inside.

The metal can be taken to a local scrap metal yard where they will weigh it out and give you some cash for it.

The foam can be dropped at a carpet manufacturer who will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. We recommend calling around to local carpet manufacturers to see who will accept foam before heading to their facility.
