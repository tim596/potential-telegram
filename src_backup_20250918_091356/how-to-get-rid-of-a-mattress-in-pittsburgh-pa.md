In Pittsburgh you can donate your mattress to [Goodwill](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/), [Habitat For Humanity Restore](https://www.habitatpittsburgh.org/), or the [Salvation Army](https://easternusa.salvationarmy.org/western-pennsylvania/)! BUT there are generally some strict regulations your mattress must meet in order to be accepted.

TO BE ACCEPTED FOR DONATION MATTRESSES MUST BE:  
\- Less than 5 years old (with manufacturer tag still attached  
\- No rips, tears or stains  
\- No dips or sags or structural issues

If your mattress does not meet the requirements to be donated but is still in decent condition, then you could consider selling it or giving it away for free on places like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. You’ll be surprised how many people would prefer to buy a second hand mattress rather than a brand new one!
