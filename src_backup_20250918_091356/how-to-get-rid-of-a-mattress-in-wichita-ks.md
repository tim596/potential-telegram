## Option #2: Donate it to [His Helping Hands](https://www.ccc.org/hishelpinghands)

If your mattress is in good condition you may want to think about donating it to a good cause where someone who needs it can use it. His Helping Hands is a great organization to donate furniture to and is actually one of the only donation centers in Wichita that accepts mattresses.

His Helping Hands is a community service ministry of Central Christian Church to help those living in the Wichita and Sedgwick County areas who are facing insufferable hardships, such as victims of natural disasters, families living below the poverty line, or those families considered to be “at risk.”

NOTE: _[Goodwill](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/), [Habitat for humanity](https://wichitahabitat.org/) and [Disabled American Veterans](https://wichitadav.com/) do not accept mattresses at this time._

## Option #3: Drop off at the [Brooks Landfill](https://www.wichita.gov/PWU/Pages/Brooks.aspx)

We always recommend donating or recycling your mattress before taking it to the landfill. Mattresses do not compress down in the landfill and take up a lot of unnecessary space. But if you don't have any other options in Wichita for mattress disposal you can take your items to the Brooks Landfill. The minimum charge here is $20/load and they charge $10/mattress.

If your mattress is in decent shape without any stains you will likely have great luck giving it away or selling it on an online marketplace like craigslist or facebook. There are a lot of people out there looking to get a deal on a used mattress rather than spending hundreds or thousands on a new one.

Make sure you take nice photos and ensure potential buyers of its cleanliness and that it is [bed bug](https://www.abedderworld.com/bed-bugs-in-pillow.html/) free. Also, always be smart and safe when meeting someone online and meet in a public location or have another person there at the time of sale. Happy Selling!

If you are up for a little project you can always recycle your mattress yourself. We have a whole guide on that [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

Essentially you want to tear off the cover and separate the metal and foam inside (both can be recycled locally).

You will want to take the metal to a local scrap metal yard like: [ABC Recycling](http://abcrecyclingllc.com/). Here they will weigh it out and likely pay you some cash for it. It will then get melted down and recycled.

You can take the foam to a carpet manufacturer (where they will use it to make carpet padding) or other local business that utilizes foam for products like dog beds, bean bag chairs, etc... Look on craigslist and call around to different businesses to find one that will accept it.
