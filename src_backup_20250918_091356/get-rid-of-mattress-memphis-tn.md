## 5.Donate your mattress to a local charity

![local-mattress-donation](/images/blog/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

[Donating](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) (repurposing) your mattress is a great way to get rid of your unwanted mattress and give someone else a chance to get the remaining useful life out of it. Due to sanitary concerns, and fears of  
bed bugs, most of the major donation centers are no longer accepting used mattresses.

HOWEVER, if your mattress is less than 5 years old, is free from stains and rips, and doesn’t have any bed bugs, you may be able to place it with a charity. So it is worth checking  
The following donation centers in Memphis are NOT currently accepting mattresses : [Habitat for  
Humanity](https://www.memphishabitat.com/), [The Salvation Army](https://salvationarmymemphis.org/), [Goodwill](https://www.goodwillmemphis.org/) – Riverdale Store, [The Arc](https://www.thearcmidsouth.org/), [AMVETS Memphis](https://www.supportthevets.org/).

Donation centers will likely not accept any odd size or custom mattresses like antique [3/4 beds](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-three-quarter-mattresses-to-buy-online.html/), [olympic queens](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-olympic-queen-mattresses.html/), [cot](https://www.abedderworld.com/cot-mattress.html/) mattresses, [full xl](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-full-xl-mattresses.html/), etc... but they may accept [RV mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/rv-replacement-mattress.html/) as these are in high demand.
