If your mattress is in good condition and could be used by someone else you may want to consider donating it. While the majority of donation centers in the area do not accept mattresses (no matter their condition) the Warehouse NJ does!

The Warehouse NJ collects gently used furniture, decor and household items from the surrounding communities and stores those items until they are ready to be used.  They have relationships with many other great local organizations (Bridges Outreach, Homeless Solutions, Sierra House, Isaiah House, Turning Point, Newark YMCA, International Rescue Committee, Family Connections, Home Care for You and Interfaith Food Pantry) who provide The Warehouse NJ with clients who are transitioning into new apartments. 

### Accepted items:

• Mattress (full or queen)  
• Bed Frame (twin, full or queen)  
• Bed Linens - complete sets of  
sheets only (twin, full or queen)

(twin, full or queen)

## Option #3: Drop at the [Lemcor Solid Waste Transfer Station](https://www.lemcortransfer.com/)

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress before bringing it to the landfill. Mattresses take up a lot of unnecessary space in our landfills due to their inability to compress with the other trash.

If you do decide that the landfill is the right option for you, you can drop your mattress off at the Lemcor solid waste transfer station. Residents will pay [$117/ton](https://www.lemcortransfer.com/faqs) and there is a one ton minimum charge. You can drop off here from 6am to 9pm every day of the week.

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Newark's Craigslist](https://newjersey.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in decent shape you may want to consider giving it away or selling it online. There is a large market of people looking to get a lightly used mattress for a discount rather than spending hundreds to thousands on a new one. If you are willing to go the craigslist or facebook route you can almost certainly get rid of a mattress as long as it doesn't have any sanitary concerns or major issues.

For a successful sale be sure to take nice pictures and ensure potential buyers that it does not have any stains and is bed big free. Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![man-tearing-open-an-old-mattress](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-1024x572.webp)

If you want to save some money and do the environment a favor you can opt to recycle your mattress yourself. This is a small project that includes the physical tearing apart of the mattress followed by the recycling of each material inside (metal and foam). We have a full article [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

To start you will want to tear off the cover and separate the metal and foam materials inside.

You can take the metal to a local scrap metal yard (like [Newark Scrap Metal](http://www.newarkrecycling.com/)) where they will likely even give you some cash for it. They will then melt it down and recycle it.

You can take the foam to a local business like a carpet manufacturer where they will use it to make carpet padding. Check craigslist for people looking for used foam and call around and you will be able to find someone who will take it off your hands.
