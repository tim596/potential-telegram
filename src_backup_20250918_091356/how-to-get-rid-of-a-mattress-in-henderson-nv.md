Donating your lightly used mattress to someone in need is a great option! Family members or friends are often potential recipients. You can also check with your favorite charity, church, or community center.

The [Giving Store in Henderson](https://thegivingstorenv.com/) accepts used furniture in good condition but asks that you call first before dropping off to make sure your mattress will be accepted.

\*\* **We checked with the following donations centers [Salvation Army](https://www.salvationarmysouthernnevada.org/), [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.lasvegashabitat.org/), and [Goodwill](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) and unfortunately, due to sanitary concerns and bed bug concerns, these donation centers are not accepting mattresses for donation at this time.**

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress before bringing it to the landfill. Mattresses are very hard to compress and break down and consequently take up a lot of space in our landfills.

Sometimes other options don't work out and if that is the case you can choose to bring your mattress to the Henderson area landfill and drop it off. Unlike many other landfills, they will accept mattresses for a $40 minimum fee. This is also a great option if you have a bunch of other trash to dispose of.

New Mattresses can be quite expensive, so there are many people who may not have the resources to buy a new mattress. A gently used mattress without tears, stains, or bed bugs could be a welcome item for them. Make sure you take a nice picture of your mattress and [state clearly that it doesn’t have stains](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/) or bed bugs. Maybe you can make a little extra cash and help someone else save a buck.

If you are looking to take on a small project and save some money (and the environment) you can actuially recycle your mattress yourself. To do this you will want so start by tearing off the cover and separating the materials inside.
