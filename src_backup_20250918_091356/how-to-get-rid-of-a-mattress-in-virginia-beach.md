Many of the major donation centers in Virginia Beach no longer accept mattresses. BUT if your mattress is in good condition there are still places that will accept it.

Donating a mattress in Virginia Beach can be a great way to help others in need while also keeping it out of a landfill. Here are a few options to consider when donating your mattress:

[The Salvation Army](https://salvationarmypotomac.org/hrva/locations/family-stores/): The Salvation Army often accepts mattress donations, provided they are clean and in good shape. You can schedule a pickup or drop off your mattress at a nearby location. Visit their website or call them to confirm their acceptance policy.

[Habitat for Humanity ReStore](https://www.shrhabitat.org/about-our-restores): The Habitat for Humanity ReStore accepts donations of furniture and home goods, including mattresses in good condition. Visit the ReStore in Virginia Beach or call to inquire about their donation guidelines.

[Local homeless shelters or transitional housing facilities](https://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/housing-neighborhood-preservation/homelessness/Pages/housing-resource-center.aspx): Some shelters or transitional housing organizations may accept mattress donations for their residents. Contact local organizations in Virginia Beach to see if they are in need of mattress donations.

[Freecycle:](https://www.freecycle.org/town/VirginiaBeachVA) If you're unable to find a local organization to donate your mattress, consider listing it for free on Freecycle. This can help connect you with individuals in the Virginia Beach area who may be in need of a mattress.

Remember to always check with the organization you choose to ensure they accept mattress donations and follow any specific guidelines they may have.

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress before sending it to the landfill. Mattresses take up a lot of unnecessary space in our landfills and are hard to break down. But if the landfill is your only option you can bring your mattress to the Virginia Beach Landfill. it is important to note you must be a resident to drop here.

RULES: _Proof of Virginia Beach residency is required. This includes a valid Virginia driver's license with the resident's primary Virginia Beach address. Virginia Beach residents without a local driver's license must produce a utility bill, rent receipt or check draft (with name on documentation matching picture I.D.)​ Physical proof of residency must be presented by an occupant of the vehicle to be admitted. Electronic or digital proof of residency is not accepted._

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Craigslist](https://norfolk.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

If your mattress can still get some life out of it you may want to consider giving it away or selling it on craigslist or facebook marketplace. There are a lot of people looking to get a deal on a used mattress rather than spend hundreds or thousands on a new one.

Be sure to take some nice pictures and let potential buyers know that the mattress does not have any stains or bed bugs.

Always be safe when meeting someone online and find a public setting for the transaction or have other around.

Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

If you are feeling resourceful and want to take on a small project you can always recycle your mattress yourself. This will save you some money and save the environment.

To do this you will first want to cut off the cover and separate the foam and metal inside the mattress.

The metal can be dropped at a local scrap metal yard where they will likely even give you some money for it. It will then be melted down and recycled.

The foam can be cut up and brought to a local carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. Not all carpet manufacturers accept foam from the public so it is important to call first. You can also check craigslist for businesses looking to take used foam off you hands (There are a lot from bean bag manufacturers, to dog beds, etc...)
