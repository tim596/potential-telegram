Airstream is known for the production of classy and comfortable recreational vehicles. Traveling in an Airstream is like taking your home with you for a vacation, and these trailers offer all the amenities and technology you find in a modern house. The one place that leaves some to be desired is the Airstream mattresses that come standard in their models.

If you are looking to upgrade your airstream mattress their are a few great options that allow you to get the same luxurious comfort that you expect from a mattress in your home, while on the road.

These airstream [replacement mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/rv-replacement-mattress.html/) are made by well-known reputable manufacturers who have expanded their options into custom and standard RV mattress sizes ([Rv Bunk](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-rv-bunk-mattresses.html/), [Rv Short Queen](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-short-queen-mattress.html/), [Rv King](https://www.abedderworld.com/rv-king-mattress.html/) and RV Short King)

## What Kind of Mattress Comes Standard in an Airstream?

[Airstream Supply Company](https://airstreamsupplycompany.com/) has partnered with Mobile Sleep to provide mattresses for Airstream. Airstream designs its trailers to ensure campers have all the space they need. Custom-made mattresses are installed, but even though they are custom-made, this does not necessarily mean they are the most comfortable choice.

Newer Airstream models typically have a standard twin-size mattress or a typical RV queen-size mattress, and some models have different floorplans that will require custom mattresses.

## What Are the Different Airstream Models and Sizes of Mattresses in Them?

Airstream has been crafting travel trailers since the 1930s. They have become experts in designing the perfect home on wheels for avid travelers.

Replacing your Airstream mattress might seem like a daunting task. Since the 1930s, there have been hundreds of floorplans that have been designed for Airstream owners. Luckily, most floorplans have beds in the corners of the trailers. Most Airstream models have an identical mattress design, which makes replacing them a little easier.

Eight mattress sizes for RVs are typically found in Airstream travel trailers. They are:

- 34" x 78" (curved edge)

- 47.5" x 78" (two radius corners)

-  48" x 76" (curved edge & 10" radius)

## Things To Consider When Choosing a Replacement Mattress for Your Airstream

Finding the right mattress is critical to your sleep health. People spend many hours in their beds, so you must choose a comfortable mattress. Whether you use your Airstream trailer for vacations or are a full-time traveler, you still need to sleep.

A restful night could mean the difference between a great day or a day suffering from aches and pains due to an uncomfortable mattress. Proper sleep is essential for your overall health, so you want the best possible sleeping environment at home and when you are away on vacation.

It is possible to put a regular mattress in your Airstream if it fits, and measuring your existing mattress will give you a better idea about your options.

It would be best to consider a few things when buying a replacement mattress for your Airstream.

### Sleep Position

You may have never considered your sleep position important, but it is crucial for choosing the best mattress for your Airstream. Back sleepers should choose a medium firmness, side sleepers should go with a softer mattress, and stomach sleepers usually enjoy a firmer mattress.

Couples with different sleeping positions will have a more challenging choice, and they may have to compromise.

### Your Weight

You may not want to consider your weight, but it is another crucial factor in choosing the perfect mattress. Your weight will affect the feel of the mattress, and it will determine how much you sink, the cooling, and the support the mattress provides to your body.

### Temperature Regulation

People who tend to overheat should consider a mattress that offers cooling features. There are many different options to help hot sleepers. You will want to choose a mattress with good airflow, which will help with temperature control.

### Budget

Your budget will also affect your choice of mattresses. You may not be willing to invest a significant amount of money in a mattress for your Airstream if you only use it occasionally. People who use their travel trailers more often may be willing to invest in a more expensive mattress.

### Motion Transfer

Some mattresses are designed to limit the amount of motion transfer so you can move around without disturbing your partner.

### Storage

If you need to store your Airstream mattress when it is not being used might significantly affect the number of choices you have. You will want a lighter mattress so you can transport it quickly from place to place.

The type of mattress you want will determine the price you are going to pay. Typically, more comfortable mattresses will cost a little more, and Pricier mattresses also tend to be more durable. If you only use the mattress during vacation and camping season, a good mattress should last the lifetime of your RV.

## Latex vs. Memory Foam vs. Hybrid Mattresses

Now you must decide what type of mattress you want to purchase. You have three options, and you can choose a latex, memory foam, or hybrid mattress. Each type has different benefits, and you will need to determine which benefits are most important for your sleep experience.

### Latex Mattress

Latex mattresses are constructed with materials taken from the rubber tree, and these mattresses have more airflow and bounce. Latex mattresses are incredibly comfortable, but they may be challenging to find to fit your Airstream.

[Sleepez](https://sleepez.com/) has two thickness options for RV latex mattresses. They have custom sizes, which are easy to transport and durable. They support your body and minimize pressure points. Mattresses come with a [cotton](https://www.abedderworld.com/cotton-mattresses.html/) cover.

You can find another excellent latex mattress at Mattress Insider. They have an 8.5" Latex RV mattress that promises comfort, support, and durability.

Their latex mattresses are great for withstanding extreme temperature fluctuations. Your mattress must be durable enough to withstand these changes if you store your RV at freezing temperatures and then have it out in extreme heat.

Their latex mattresses have excellent airflow, so you will sleep cool wherever you travel. They offer a 20-year warranty and up to 121 days to ask for a refund if you are unhappy with your mattress.

### Memory Foam Mattress

RV owners often choose memory foam mattresses because of their lightweight. Fortunately, you do not have to sacrifice comfort because many foam mattresses provide incredible comfort.

You can find a great memory foam mattress at [Brooklyn Bedding](https://brooklynbedding.com/). One of the best memory foam RV mattresses today is the Brooklyn Bedding Wanderlust.

This mattress is designed for recreational vehicles. It is available in five different profiles and several different sizes, so you are sure to find one that is compatible with your Airstream.

The Wanderlust is a fantastic mattress for minimizing pressure points and motion transfer. The thicker options are the most comfortable, but if your sleeping quarters require a lower mattress, you will be happy with the six or [8-inch mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/8-inch-vs-10-inch-thick-mattress.html/).

Sleepers will find these mattresses great for temperature control.

RV owners searching for a memory foam mattress should consider a Nectar mattress. The [Nectar](https://www.nectarsleep.com/) is made with gel-infused memory foam, providing incredible comfort and support. This mattress works well for back and side sleepers and will also help people who suffer from joint pain.

RV owners who are budget conscious will appreciate that this mattress is one of the most affordable on the market today. This mattress has free shipping and a free 365-day trial.

### Hybrid Mattress

A hybrid mattress is the best of both worlds, and it is constructed with layers of foam or latex and the coil springs you would find in a typical innerspring mattress.

If you want some of the best sleep of your life, you should consider the luxury hybrid mattress from [DreamCloud](https://www.dreamcloudsleep.com/). These mattresses are designed to provide the best body support possible, and mattresses come with an incredibly soft cashmere cover.

You will enjoy the same comfort as sleeping in your bed in your own home. The Dream Cloud Hybrid mattress is excellent for any sleeping position. The hybrid mattresses are a little pricier than other types of mattresses, but you get what you pay for. You won't mind the added cost when you realize how comfortable your nights can be.

The higher cost comes with the bonus of a free 365-day trial. You can test it and decide if this mattress is the right choice for you. DreamCloud offers free returns for an entire year and a lifetime warranty.

Another great option is the GhostBed hybrid mattress. This mattress has incredible airflow due to its construction with 6 inches of springs, and the upper layers of foam stay cool and whisk excess body heat away.

The [GhostBed](https://www.ghostbed.com/) hybrid mattress is excellent for all sleep positions, so it is a great choice for couples. The mattress minimizes motion transfer, so it is perfect for couples with different schedules.

You have the opportunity to try out the mattress for 101 nights, and there is no cost for shipping. The company offers a 25-year warranty on their product.

## Mattress Covers

If you plan on replacing your Airstream mattress, it is essential to include the cost of a mattress cover into your budget. A mattress can be expensive, and you will want to protect it for as long as possible. A mattress cover helps keep your bed looking brand new.

There are different types of mattress covers or pads that you can purchase. A mattress cover is usually a thinner cover designed to protect your mattress from wear and tear. A mattress pad is generally thicker and offers another layer of softness for your bed.

You can buy waterproof mattress covers that will protect your mattress against spills. Let's face it; the rules are not always the same in a trailer, so liquids may find their way into the bedroom. Mattress covers protect your mattress from stains and bedbugs and help prevent allergies.

Most companies that sell mattresses will sell the mattress covers as well. They are easy to care for because they can be removed easily and thrown in the washer. Washing a mattress cover once in a while is much less costly than replacing your mattress.

## Final Thoughts

A comfy bed is necessary for a good night's sleep. When on vacation, people want the comfort they would find at home. Holidays can become much less relaxed if you are sleep deprived or uncomfortable because of aches and pains from a less-than-stellar mattress.

Your Airstream is your home away from home, so you want to ensure that it has all the comforts of your home. Your mattress is probably one of the most critical factors when achieving restful sleep. We don't think about our time on our mattresses, but it is a third of our day. It should be the most comfortable that we can make it.
