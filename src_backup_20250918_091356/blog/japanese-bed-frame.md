# 12 "Design Winning" Japanese Style Bed Frames

If you love [Japanese inspired minimalist design](https://www.sapporo.co.uk/news/the-art-of-less-is-more-japanese-minimalism-and-its-influence-on-western-design-aesthetics/#:~:text=Inspired%20by%20the%20spartan%20aesthetic,ancient%20customs%20and%20a%20love) and are looking to buy a bed frame inspired by that style, then you have come to the right place. In this post we have compiled all of our favorite Japanese style bed frames for you to choose from.  A Japanese bed frame is generally [low to the ground](https://www.abedderworld.com/low-bed-frames.html/) and utilizes a [minimalist](https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/) design. The Japanese are innovators in the minimalist space and have great influence on interior design styles. All of the bed frames in this post come in a variety of [standard sizes](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-sizes) from twin to king.

## What is a "japanese" bed frame?

There are a variety of different kinds of Japanese bed frames. In general the Japanese have smaller living quarters and their bedroom often will function as a living space during the day. If they don't sleep on the floor, their [beds are either minimalist in design or fold](https://www.abedderworld.com/fold-up-bed.html/) up for easy storage or function during the day. 

## The different kinds of Japanese bed frames

The Japanese have inspired and invented many of the different beds and furniture styles that are used across the world today. Whether you need a tatami bed, a futon that can fold up into a couch or a low sitting minimalist bed, you can thank the Japanese for their inspiration and functional designs. 

- **Low minimalist platform bed** - Low minimalist platform beds are extremely popular in the furniture design space. The low design is modern and simple just as the [Japanese style](https://www.abedderworld.com/japanese-joinery-bed-frames.html/) suggests. 

- **Futon frame-** Futons fold from a couch into a bed and back again. They are great for bedrooms that are also used as seating or living spaces. Futons are Japanese creations and are now widely popular across the world. Futons are also generally much more comfortable than a pullout couch. 

- **Tatami bed frame -** A tatami bed frame is a bed that hold tatami mats, which are Japanese mats/pads that are used in place of a mattress. The Japanese are used to sleeping on the floor so they prefer a firmer more simple pad to sleep on rather than a [thick mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/mattress-thickness-guide-everything-you-need-to-know.html/). 

All of the beds on this list can be used with a Japanese [futon mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/futon-mattresses.html/) OR a traditional style mattress. Additionally, none of the bed frames on this list [require the use of a box spring](https://www.abedderworld.com/25-bed-frames-you-can-use-without-a-box-spring.html/) (you can put your mattress directly on the frame).

## Does Japan Use Bed Frames?

Some of the people of Japan have slowly began to adopt some of the Western style mattress and bed frames. BUT the vast majority still sleep on a traditional very thin mattress over a Tatami mat. A Tatami mat is made of compressed straw and is believed to be great for the back and muscle relief. A traditional Japanese tatami mat and thin mattress are rolled up during the day when not in use and rolled back out at night. This allows for the "bedroom" to have multiple functions in the home.

## Do The Japanese still sleep on the floor?

Yes, many Japanese households sleep on the [floor](https://www.abedderworld.com/8-best-floor-mattress-options-of-2020.html/) on a tatami mat and a very thin mattress. This has always been a part of Japanese culture. The tatami mat is made of straw and is a simple and firm way to sleep that is believed to be great for the body.

## Can I Use a Japanese Futon on a Bed Frame?

Yes, a Japanese futon can be used on a low platform bed rather than on a tatami mat. A low bed frame with slats will provide support for your futon mattress while still keeping the bed low enough to get air circulation.

## What are the benefits of sleeping on a Japanese Bed Frame?

- AIR CIRCULATION - Japanese beds are low to the ground which allows for you to sleep in better air circulation than when sleeping up too high. This also helps you to sleep cooler, as cold air is lower to the ground.

- SUPPORT - A traditional Japanese bed consists of a thin mattress with a tatami mat underneath. This is very firm and is great for supporting your spine and back. The Japanese also believe that this is great for muscle relief.

- SIMPLE & MINIMALIST - Less is more when it comes to Japanese bed frames. The Japanese like to minimize clutter and use functional and simple products. The Japanese bed frame doesn't take up a lot of space and uses clean simple lines to keep the bedroom a peaceful and simple oasis for sleep.

## Do Japanese Beds Need a Box Spring?

Most bed frames that get their inspiration from Japanese culture do not require a box spring. Instead these beds use built in bed slats. Built in bed slats allow customers to skip using a box spring and put their mattress or futon directly on the beds slats. This makes them sleep lower to the ground and have a more minimalist design and appearance.

## Getting rid of your old bed set

If you are purchasing a new [bed frame](https://www.abedderworld.com/black-bed-frame.html/), chances are you will need to get rid of your old one. Most online companies will now take away your old items when your bed set is delivered. Luckily, we provide mattress and bes set removal and recycling services. A Bedder World has recycled over 500K mattresses to date. Simply [book a pick up online](https://www.abedderworld.com/book-online/), put your items outside by 8am and POOF we will come by and take them away. 

Overall, there are a lot of Japanese style bed frames available on the market today. You will want to look at the price range and how long you need your bed to last. As with anything you get what you pay for. Many of the more expensive bed sets are going to last for years and years while some of the cheaper sets are probably best for a few years. All the recommendations on this page are through companies we personally trust and that have a long standing reputatyion in the industry.
