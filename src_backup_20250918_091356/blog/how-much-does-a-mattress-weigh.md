# How Much Does a Mattress Weigh? \[Weight Chart\]

If you are looking to move a mattress or [ship](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-ship-a-mattress.html/) one you may be wondering how much does does a mattress weigh? The answer depends on the [materials](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-information/mattress-types) used and the size of the mattress (we have weight charts for both below)

![how-much-does-a-mattress-weigh-banner](/images/blog/Most-Attractive-Youtube-Thumbnail-85-1024x576.png)

If you’re curious to learn more about how much your mattress weighs, read on to learn a brief guideline. Afterward, if you are planning to move your mattress we'll cover how to lift your mattress safely. 

## Mattress Weight by Size:

| Mattress Size: | Width x Length (inches) | Avg. Weight (lbs) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Twin | 38" x 75" | 40-100 lbs |
| Twin XL | 38" x 80" | 43-105 lbs |
| Full | 54" x 75" | 50-110 lbs |
| Queen | 60" x 80" | 90-160 lbs |
| King | 76" x 80" | 115-180 lbs |
| California King | 72" x 84" | 130-180 lbs |

### Weight of Odd size mattresses:

- [Narrow Twin Mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/cot-mattress.html/) - weighs less than a twin size mattress

- [Three-Quarter Mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-three-quarter-mattresses-to-buy-online.html/) - weight in between a twin and full size

- [Full Xl Mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-full-xl-mattresses.html/) - weight in between a full and queen

- [Short Queen Mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-short-queen-mattress.html/) - weight in between a full and queen

- [Olympic Queen Mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-olympic-queen-mattresses.html/) - weight in between a queen and king

- [Short King Mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/rv-king-mattress.html/) - weight in between a queen and king

- Oversized [Family](https://www.abedderworld.com/family-bed.html/) Mattresses: [Wyoming king](https://www.abedderworld.com/wyoming-king-bed.html/) , [Alaskan king](https://www.abedderworld.com/alaskan-king-bed-5-places-to-buy-one-online.html/), [Texas king](https://www.abedderworld.com/texas-king-bed.html/)... will all weigh well above 200lbs and will need to be specially shipped and likely will incur additional shipping fees.

Split mattresses like a [split queen](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-split-queen-mattress.html/) or [split cali king](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-split-california-king-mattress.html/) will weigh about the same as the weights above.

Other than the materials used, the size of a mattress is the most important factor in its weight. A larger mattress means more materials, so a larger mattress will always weigh more.

It’s also important to note that size affects how easy a mattress is to carry. If you’re calculating weight for construction, the ease of carrying a mattress isn’t as important. But if you’re calculating so that you can lift the mattress, it’s important to know how unwieldy it may be.

### Twin

The smallest mattress size is a twin-sized mattress. From front to bottom, a twin-sized mattress is typically 38 inches by 75 inches. 

These mattresses are often also called single mattresses, as they can only comfortably fit one person. Many people purchase two twin mattresses and put them together, which is the reason for the name.

Despite the names referring to the same size, you may sometimes see a mattress store sell a smaller bed and call it a single mattress. These mattresses are usually roughly 30 inches by 75 inches.

### Twin XL

The twin XL mattress is the same width as a twin mattress. The XL edition is an extra 5 inches or so in length. Twin XL mattresses are meant for single-bed occupants that are [taller](https://www.abedderworld.com/the-best-mattress-for-a-tall-person.html/) than average and need the extra five inches to comfortably stretch. Five inches may not sound like much, but it might be all you need to keep your feet from hanging off the bed.

### Full

A full mattress is the second size beyond a twin mattress. Because they’re only one step larger (not counting an XL’s extra length), they’re still best for a single occupant. Whereas twin mattresses are good for teens or children, a full mattress best fits an adult.

A full-size mattress is 56 inches by 75 inches. Depending on the materials used, these mattresses usually weigh roughly 50 pounds.

### Queen

Queen-size mattresses are the most popular mattresses. These mattresses give ample room to spread out as a single adult while comfortably fitting a second occupant.

A queen measures 60 inches by 80 inches. They take up less space than a king while still providing comfortable rest. These mattresses will usually weigh twice what a full-size mattress weighs at roughly 120 pounds.

### King

King mattresses are popular for couples but often take up too much room for a single sleeper. A king mattress is 76 inches by 80 inches.

Compared to a queen mattress, these beds are the same length but significantly wider. The extra 16 inches provide comfortable room for a partner. Many can even fit a third, such as a child sleeping with their parents.

### California King

The largest standard size for a mattress is the California king. They’re technically the same size as a King but with slightly different dimensions. The California king mattress is 72 inches by 84 inches.

The size measurement cuts 4 inches off of the width to be 4 inches longer. By doing so, they better fit taller couples and occupants. The 4 inches of width is rarely missed, as 72 inches is still 36 inches of personal space.

These mattresses usually weigh the most at roughly 160 pounds. Denser materials will increase the weight considerably.

## Mattress Weight by Material:

| **Type of Mattress**: | **Weight** (lbs): |
| --- | --- |
| **Hybrid mattresses** | 40-130lbs |
| **Innerspring mattresses** | 60-160 lbs |
| **Latex mattresses** | 90-165 lbs |
| **Memory foam mattresses** | 70-160 lbs |

Unsurprisingly, the main factor in the weight of your mattress is what material it’s made of. If you’ve ever considered a pound of [feathers](https://www.abedderworld.com/feather-pillows.html/) versus a pound of iron, you understand how the materials used will affect weight.

Mattresses are not often made with a single material. However, the type of mattress will remain the primary factor in the weight of your mattress. Here are some of the most common mattress materials and how they’ll affect the weight.

### Memory Foam

![cooling-gel-memory-foam-topper-365591_1300x](/images/blog/cooling-gel-memory-foam-topper-365591_1300x-1024x683.webp)

Memory foam is one of the most common materials used in mattresses today. People love memory foam for comfort, but the material is often dense. Due to their density, memory foam mattresses will often weigh more than many other types.

In particular, the outermost layer is a low-density foam layer. Inside, the foam is denser to help encourage firmness. For some models, the thicker the foam, the more the mattress will weigh.

### Innerspring

![](/images/blog/innerspring-rv-mattress.jpg)

Innerspring mattresses are one of the few that have a high amount of metal components. The springs inside are steel coils that act as a support base. These springs are topped with a thin pillow top, fiberfill, or foam so that the coils don’t dig into your back.

The number of springs, their size, and more will affect weight. The area between the springs is typically empty, making it so that an innerspring mattress has plenty of open space beneath the top pillow. 

Because of this quality, innerspring mattresses are often lighter than most other types. They’re also easier to move due to being more rigid and weighing less.

### Latex

![latex-mattress-topper-dunlop](/images/blog/shutterstock_233390269_eea616fd-8f7f-4d1e-81ae-1a9fbdf85196_grande.jpeg)

Latex mattresses aren’t as common as memory foam or innerspring. They’re built similarly to memory foam mattresses. Due to the similarity in build construction, latex mattresses often weigh the same as memory foam mattresses.

The difference in weight between latex mattresses is due to the number of layers and density. Firmer latex mattresses are denser. Larger or softer mattresses may have more layers. You’ll want to go on a case-by-case basis when weighing latex mattresses.

### Airbed

![floor-air-mattress](/images/blog/71fe-exIuL._AC_SL1500_-1024x650.jpg)

Airbeds are typically the lightest on the market. An airbed mattress (often called an air mattress) is made of an inflatable material that can [deflate](_wp_link_placeholder), collapse, and store easily. The material is often heavy-duty to prevent accidental puncture. Cheaper mattresses are thinner, which makes them lighter. On the other hand, inexpensive mattresses are usually lower quality. 

Inside the mattress, different models may give support areas. These areas are thicker, have an inflatable support, or have a textured feel. This mattress is filled with only air, as the name suggests.

Due to essentially being a balloon, airbeds are the lightest available beds. A thick, firm, high-quality airbed will likely weigh more than a light, low-quality airbed.

### Hybrids

![supportive-firm-bear-elite-mattress](/images/blog/StrongSupport_EliteHybrid_554x416_fb1c03d9-d69c-49fc-94df-c6454504b6d8.webp)

Hybrid mattresses will often combine memory foam or latex with innerspring coils. The innerspring helps provide structure and lightness, while the foam provides comfort and prevents the springs.

These mattresses also often have the most layers of the available types. Inside, the foam is often between the springs.

Because of the combination of materials, you get the best of [support and comfort](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/healthy-living/mental-health-and-relationships/get-enough-sleep#:~:text=Health%20Benefits&text=Get%20sick%20less%20often,stress%20and%20improve%20your%20mood). Unfortunately, you also get the most weight. Hybrid mattresses are the heaviest type of mainstream mattresses on the market.

## Other Factors

Now that we understand the types of materials used for mattresses, what other factors go into the weight?

One common trait is that an older mattress will weigh more. This is because a mattress will [absorb foreign materials](https://www.livescience.com/33097-does-your-mattress-really-gain-weight-over-time-.html) and settle, making it heavier. While there is a slight difference in weight between two mattresses of the same make but different ages, they aren’t always heavier with age.

Conversely, some mattresses get lighter with age. This occurs when foam rubs away or tears down, springs break or corrode, and more.

The largest factor in a mattress’s weight beyond the material is the size. Mattresses come in six sizes, though customized mattresses can fit a separate category. The largest of these, California King, will almost always weigh more than anything else.

### Thickness and Height

Two other factors are the [thickness](https://www.abedderworld.com/mattress-thickness-guide-everything-you-need-to-know.html/) and height of a mattress. Thicker mattresses have more materials, may have a higher density, and typically have more layers. Because of these three factors, a thicker mattress will always weigh more than a thinner mattress of the same material.

The height of a mattress depends on several factors. For an innerspring mattress, higher means larger springs. While larger springs will weigh more, much of the interior is still empty. The mattress _will_ weigh more than a shorter innerspring mattress, but not by a massive margin.

On the other hand, hybrid mattresses will weigh considerably more. Foam and latex mattresses will also weigh significantly more. The extra weight is because making a foam, latex, or hybrid mattress higher means adding more dense materials.

When purchasing a mattress, look at the height, thickness, size, and material. These four qualities will help you deduce how heavy the mattress may be. You should also ask a representative, if available, as they should have such details for you.

## How to Move a Mattress Safely

With so much discussion around a mattress’s weight, knowing how to move one safely is crucial. Lifting a nearly 200-pound California king is dangerous, straining, and can quickly become hazardous. Here are some safety tips for [moving your mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-move-a-mattress-alone.html/).

### Lift Correctly

The most important part of lifting anything heavy is to lift it correctly. Lifting with incorrect posture or methodology can [cause injury](https://www.worksafebc.com/en/health-safety/hazards-exposures/lifting-handling#:~:text=Lifting%2C%20handling%2C%20or%20carrying%20objects,the%20risk%20and%20prevent%20injuries.). These injuries may not happen immediately but will compound over time. You may also pull a muscle or rupture something, such as a hernia.

It’s best to securely hook your hands under the mattress at a firm, comfortable angle. Crouch with your knees rather than bending your back. Once you have your grip, stand up by straightening your legs rather than leveraging your back.

Doing so puts more weight on your legs and knees. Your back cannot easily handle the same weight, making this significantly safer.

### Don’t Work Alone

Mattresses are large, heavy, and unwieldy. Transporting one alone is not only difficult, but it may also prove impossible! If you’re moving the mattress to a truck, you won’t want to drag it along the ground until you reach the vehicle.

Make sure you have at least one other person with you. If the mattress is small and light, such as a twin innerspring mattress, one person can safely lift them with proper posture. A larger mattress such as a full, queen, or larger, cannot be safely lifted by one person.

### Clear the Area

While moving a mattress, it’s difficult to see where you’re going. You’ll likely have the mattress below your chin and will need to keep your head up for hazards. Going through doorways or hallways without looking may cause you to drop your bed. 

Because of this hazard, you should clear the area beforehand. Move any toys, backpacks, clothes, or other tripping hazards. It’s also a good idea to have a friend watching to make sure you don’t unexpectedly find a set of stairs.

### Don’t Overlift

When needing to move a mattress, you may bite off more than you can chew. You might feel you can move a pillowy bed by yourself or that you're able to lift more weight than usual with someone helping.

Overlifting can cause serious injury. Only take what you can handle instead of rushing through the task. You’ll move your mattress much slower if you pull a muscle or injure yourself. 

### Expect Flex

Most mattress materials are flexible. This quality can make them hazardous to carry, particularly if you expect a rigid material.

Foam mattresses are particularly bendy. Account for and expect the bed to shift and move in this manner while carrying it. Anticipating the bend can stop you from accidentally pivoting and dropping the mattress on your friend.

## Sleeping Well

A mattress's weight is directly related to its size and the materials used to construct it. A hybrid California king mattress will likely weigh more than any other mattress, whereas an innerspring or airbed twin mattress is the lightest. Make sure you safely transport any mattresses when moving them.
