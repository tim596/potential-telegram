# 7 Budget Friendly Alternatives to The "Thuma" Bed Frame

If you’re in the market for a new bed frame, you may have come across the brand name [Thuma](https://www.thuma.co/products/the-bed).

![thuma-alternative-bed-frame-options](/images/blog/Most-Attractive-Youtube-Thumbnail-2023-02-23T095948.990-1024x576.png)

Thuma is undoubtedly one of the leading names in the market for [online bed frames](https://www.insider.com/guides/home/best-bed-frame) but this quality comes with a high price point.

For many people, Thuma bed frames are out of their budget range but that doesn’t mean that you have to compromise and settle for frames of lower quality and with fewer features.

There are many bed frames on the market that are similar to Thuma frames but don’t have the high price tag. In this article, we will introduce you to some of these options so that you can choose the bed frame that suits your needs the best.

NOTE: Thuma is a platform style bed. This means it uses slats for support and you DO NOT need to use a box spring. If this is what you love about Thuma, then check out our other post for [25 bed frames that do not require a box spring!](https://www.abedderworld.com/25-bed-frames-you-can-use-without-a-box-spring.html/)

## About Thuma Beds

![thuma-bed-frame-image](/images/blog/large-1024x903.jpeg)

### Main Features of Thuma

- Platform bed that does not require a box spring (put your mattress directly on it!)

- Modern, simple design with fabric and wood

- Slips together without any tools

Before we look at alternatives for Thuma bed frames, let’s take a closer look at Thuma and why their bed frames are so popular.

[Thuma launched in San Francisco in 2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhochman/2021/05/19/how-thuma-made-boring-bed-frames-dreamy-again/?sh=4fc349cf4f80) with the aim of making bed frames less of an afterthought when it comes to buying new beds.

Often, purchasers concentrate on mattresses and bedding more than the solid frame that is the foundation of the bed. Their frames are simple and understated but offer a level of comfort and luxury that is noticeable from the start. 

Thuma takes inspiration from Japanese craftsmanship to make frames that can be easily self-assembled at home while not sacrificing strength or quality.

They use recycled wood and upcycled wood and are also GREENGUARD Gold certified so you can be sure that their bed frames are eco-friendly and safe from harmful chemicals. Thuma has also partnered with One Tree Planted so that for every bed sold, a new tree is planted.

You can purchase a Thuma bed frame in several different sizes ranging from Twin to Cali King. Three different wood finishes are available (walnut, natural, and espresso) and the beds can have either pillow boards or headboards.

The various options have a great effect on the price, but the bed frames typically range from around $800 to $2000.

### What our testers are saying:

This headboard on this bed is very similar in design to that of the upholstered headboard on the Thuma bed but this one is actually attached to the frame, making it sturdier.

**The strength and sturdiness** of this bed are noteworthy. With its solid wood legs and metal center supports, it easily handles weight up to 1000lbs, making it a great choice for those seeking a durable option. We've had our fair share of beds, but this one truly stands out in terms of stability.

The **aesthetic appeal** is another win. The linen-blend fabric on the headboard not only feels premium but also adds a touch of sophistication to any room. The woven fabric details are subtle yet impactful and comfortable to rest against when reading or watching tv in bed.

The headboard is solid and doesn't shake, move or squeak under pressure. We also loved the fact that you can adjust the headboard's height, ensuring it looked just right against the wall and fits with any thickness of mattress.

In conclusion, our experience with this bed has been nothing short of fantastic. It's a blend of durability and design, making it an excellent choice for anyone in the market for a new durable bed that can hold heavier weight loads without moving, shaking or squeaking.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

Now that we’ve introduced our five alternatives for Thuma beds, let’s answer some lingering questions. 

### **Is It Possible To Buy A Thuma Bed For Less?**

Like many companies, Thuma does hold time-limited sales occasionally. We would recommend checking their site or social media for these and also signing up for their newsletter. Any special offers will be notified to customers via these methods.

You also have the option of purchasing second-hand, if you’re lucky enough to find any. Check online sales sites such as eBay and local selling groups on Facebook and you may be able to find a bargain.

Make sure you are able to fully check what you’re buying before spending any money though!

### **Why Should I Invest So Much Money In A Bed Frame?**

So many people invest large amounts of money into high-quality mattresses and often neglect their bed frames. In our opinion, this is a mistake. Your bed frame is [just as important as your mattress](https://www.quaggadesigns.com/post/importance-of-having-a-good-bed-frame) as the frame gives the mattress the support it needs in order to support you.

By spending a decent amount of money on the right bed frame, you will have a frame that can last you for decades.

A good bed frame will help you sleep soundly for years as it will support your body the way it should be supported. Although it may be a large expense now, a solid bed frame will pay for itself through a better night’s sleep and how long it can last.

Plus, a stylish bed frame can really make your bedroom look and feel more modern and comfortable!
