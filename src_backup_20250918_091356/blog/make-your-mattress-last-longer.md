![](/images/blog/Gel-Swirl-Topper-Hand-Imprint_635x_crop_center.jpeg)

When you buy a mattress they tend to tell you it can last from 5-10 years depending on the brand and quality. In recent years mattress manufacturers have been shortening the recommended mattress "lifespan" partially due to the need to sell more mattresses and partially due to a decrease in quality products. If you are wondering how to extend the life of your current mattress, you have come to the right place. Below we have listed our top "tips and tricks" for getting the longest life out of your mattress. 

## 5 Ways to Make Your Mattress Last Longer

## 1\. Before you do anything...Check your bed frame

![sagging-mattress-support](/images/blog/BED-SLATS-8.png)

**Sometimes the [sagging or breaking down of a mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-fix-a-sagging-mattress.html/) is actually due to what is happening beneath your mattress.While everything may look fine on top, it is important to check your support system occasionally for any issues.**

**To check your bed frame's support system, follow these steps:**

1. Take off your mattress. Analyze your bed slats or [box spring for any cracks, broken sections, etc..](_wp_link_placeholder). By simply putting your hand on the top of the box spring and pushing down in different spots you will quickly be able to tell if a crack is present.

2. If your box spring or [bed slats](https://www.abedderworld.com/bed-slats.html/) are in working condition, you can take them off and analyze your bed frame. Your [bed frame](https://www.abedderworld.com/can-a-bed-frame-cause-back-pain.html/) should be on level ground and all feet should be touching the floor (including the center feet). A queen or king size bed frame MUST have a center support bar with feet touching the ground.

    * * *

3. If your frame does not have a center support bar it will cause your mattress to sag. The majority of [bed frames](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-bed-frame-for-purple-mattress.html/) are made with a center support but we have seen many that are manufactured without it as well. 

## 2\. Mattress Sagging? Add an Anti Sag Support

Certain mattress toppers are designed for making your bed softer. Toppers are essentially thick, responsive, mattress-sized pieces of foam you roll out and lay on the top of your mattress. The proper mattress topper is able to provide a whole new feel to an overly [firm mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-extra-firm-mattress.html/). It's typically 2 or 3 inches in height, and you can choose from different levels of softness. There are two main types of mattress toppers to choose from.

## 3\. Mattress Too Soft OR Too Firm? Add the Firming/Softening Topper

Certain mattress toppers are designed for making your bed softer. Toppers are essentially thick, responsive, mattress-sized pieces of foam you roll out and lay on the top of your mattress. The proper mattress topper is able to provide a whole new feel to an overly [firm mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-extra-firm-mattress.html/). It's typically 2 or 3 inches in height, and you can choose from different levels of softness. There are two main types of mattress toppers to choose from.

[**Memory Foam Mattress Toppers:**](https://www.abedderworld.com/gel-memory-foam-mattress-topper.html/) Memory foam mattress toppers provide a significant level of softness, comfort and pressure relief while still supporting your body. Memory foam is an elastic-like foam that conforms to the curves of your body. Memory foam was initially invented by NASA and has quickly become one of the most popular sleep materials in the industry. 

\

[**Latex Mattress Toppers**:](https://www.abedderworld.com/natural-latex-mattress-toppers.html/) Latex foam is more springy and responsive than memory foam. If you want a soft feel without the sinking effect, a latex topper might be for you. Latex is an all natural product that is poured and molded out of the rubber tree. Latex is also great if you have allergies or want a completely chemical free sleep environment. Latex comes in a variety of firmnesses and if you are looking to soften your sleeping surface, one of the softer options will be a great option for you.

## 4\. Need Comfort? Add a Mattress Pad

Mattress pads are a thin quilted layer of [cotton](https://www.abedderworld.com/cotton-comforter.html/) or [wool](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-wool-mattress-pads-toppers.html/) padding that add less support than a mattress topper, but do add cushioning in order to add comfort and make a mattress feel softer. They also smooth out any crevices in your mattress for a flatter feel. Some mattress pads include temperature regulating technology, such as heating or a cooling gel to dispel body heat. If you only need a slightly softer feel, a mattress pad might be the way to go.

\

## 5\. Mattress Dirty? Add a Mattress Protector

A [mattress protector](https://www.us-mattress.com/mattress-protectors.html) is a thin but waterproof covering made to protect your mattress from spills and dirt and dust mites. Many mattress protectors contain a thin fabric or padding layer that helps make your bed softer. Adding one to your mattress or on top of a mattress pad can help add softness.

\

## 6\. Rotate/Flip Your Mattress

If you have an older mattress, flipping or rotating it may reveal a flatter, less broken down side to the mattress that still has plenty of life left in its materials. If your mattress feels lumpy, try turning it over horizontally and rotating it around so that you're sleeping on the opposite side as before. You can repeat this every six months to continually get the best shape and cushiony feel from your mattress. 

## What is causing my mattress to feel hard?

A firm mattress is generally caused by denser foams and a firmer support foam or innerspring unit. Firmer mattresses generally have less comfort layers on top of their support system or base foam, which makes them feel firmer. By simply adding additional comfort layers on top of your mattress you can achieve a softer feel, while still benefitting from the support system of your mattress. 

## Is an old mattress bad for my back?

If you have a bad back generally it is recommended that a firmer mattress is better due to the increased support and [spinal alignment](https://www.abedderworld.com/top-chiropractor-recommended-mattresses.html/). The most important thing is to make sure you have a quality mattress that is supportive. A softer mattress that is supportive will still be a quality sleeping surface for your back.

## Can I Combine These Tips ?

The more of these techniques you use, the longer your mattress will generally last. Whether you need to add onto your mattress or simply [f](https://www.us-mattress.com/breaking-in-a-new-mattress.html)lip it around, you can always continue adjusting the feel and quality of your mattress by trying any of the techniques above. Once you've improved your bed's feel, you can enjoy better sleep with adequate support.
