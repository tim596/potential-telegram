Anyone who has purchased a [new mattress online](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-mattresses-buy-online.html) always seems to be amazed that it can [fit in its box](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-a-bed-in-a-box-worth-it.html/).

## How To Vacuum Seal A Foam Mattress: Step by Step Guide

Even if you aren’t thinking of returning your mattress, knowing how to store it is helpful if you’re in a moving situation. 

Before you do this [vacuum](https://www.abedderworld.com/mattress-vacuums.html/) seal method of storing, see if you can find out whether it’s suitable to do so on your mattress.

You could perhaps check the manufacturer's website to see how they recommend [storing](https://www.bhg.com/decorating/storage/how-to-store-a-mattress/) their products. 

This method will only work for [foam mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/king-size-memory-foam-mattress.html/), so do not attempt with [latex](https://www.abedderworld.com/natural-latex-mattress-toppers.html/) or spring ones. 

Before you get started, you need to make sure that you have a ratchet strap set, a vacuum bag, some duct tape, and a mattress bag. Follow these steps to find out how to vacuum seal your mattress. 

## First: Collect All Of Your Necessary Items

### **Mattress Bag**

You must put your mattress inside a plastic mattress bag before you can compress it. These bags can be found at a reasonable price at the majority of the nation's largest retailers as well as stores that specialize in selling mattresses. 

Your ideal bag would be made of sturdy, heavy-duty plastic and have a closure of some kind.

Your mattress must precisely match the dimensions of the bag that you use to transport it.

While it may be tempting to try and fit a bigger mattress into whatever mattress bag you have lying around unless it’s the right size it won’t work!

Also, avoid purchasing a bag that is too large; otherwise, the compression capabilities might not be as effective.

### **Ratchet Straps**

After it has been rolled and compacted, the mattress will be secured using ratchet straps.

You should be able to pick some up for a reasonable price from a hardware or home improvement store.

By providing you with a more secure handhold, these straps will make it much simpler for you to transport the compressed mattress. They will also stop the mattress from unrolling.

### **Vacuum Bag Valve**

You need to find a vacuum bag and take the valve off of it. This valve is going to be attached to the mattress bag. 

### **Duct Tape** 

Before you are through compressing the mattress, you will wrap it in duct tape to seal any gaps 

## Step-by-Step: How To Compress Your Mattress

1. Before you begin the process of compressing your mattress, you need to be sure that all of the sheets and blankets have been removed from it. Nothing at all, not even the mattress protector, should be left on top of it.

3. After doing so, place the mattress bag on top of the mattress. If you think that completing this task on your own will be challenging, ask a friend to assist you to make things simpler.

5. If you decided to use a mattress bag that can be sealed, then you should go ahead and close the bag. Applying duct tape to the seal's edges will provide additional security for the seal.

7. Place the valve on the bag of the mattress, and then trace it. After that, cut off the circle that you have traced, and then insert the vacuum bag valve into the hole that you have created. 

9. When you compress the bag, preventing air from escaping will be easier if you wrap the tape around the edges of the valve.

11. Now you can start compressing the mattress! After the valve has been repositioned, connect the vacuum's hose to it, and then power on the device. Watch in awe as the air is removed from the mattress, causing it to become flatter than before.

13. After the mattress has been pressed down, roll it up in a horizontal direction. To prevent the mattress from expanding, make sure that the vacuum is not turned off.

15. After you have rolled up the mattress, use the ratchet straps to secure it and pull them as tight as you can so that it cannot return to its original shape. And just like that, you’re all done! 

## Will The Company Pick Up My Mattress?

When you decide to return the mattress, you will need to get in touch with the retailer you purchased it from.

The companies who sell mattresses online obviously don’t expect that their consumers will physically return the mattress to them.

However, they are not attempting to engage in any kind of bait-and-switch tactics.

In most cases, if you purchase a mattress online from a retailer, the company will arrange for someone to come to your home and [pick up the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/book-online/) so that it can be recycled or donated.

These e-commerce businesses have formed partnerships with removal companies that specialize in mattresses to collect the things that their consumers need to return. 

In most cases, the mattress store is responsible for paying any fees associated with the mattress removal business picking up the mattress.

Because the mattress retailer wants to ensure that their clients have a positive experience so that they will continue to shop with them in the future, the mattress retailer will make certain that any mattress removal company they work with is reliable, trustworthy, and well-regarded.

If you have bought your mattress from a physical store, then they may still send someone out to come and pick it up for you. However, this isn’t always the case. 

If you’ve been told that you have to return the mattress to the store yourself, then we highly recommend hiring a removal service to do it for you. 

Mattress/furniture removal services will charge to carry away and dispose of an old mattress for you, but when you think about all of the time and energy you would be saving, the price of a pickup is clearly more than worth it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Am I Able To Reroll A Spring Mattress?**

No, not only is it nearly impossible, but it will also cause the mattress to break.

If you attempt to roll or compress innerspring beds or traditional mattresses, you run the risk of [causing structural and material damage to the bed](https://www.abedderworld.com/can-a-bed-frame-cause-back-pain.html/) or mattress. 

Compression is a technique that is only recommended for mattresses that do not have traditional springs.

### **Can I Sleep On A Mattress As Soon As It’s Unrolled?** 

The entire [expansion and “inflation” of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-long-does-it-take-a-memory-foam-mattress-to-expand.html/) can take as little as a few hours or as long as forty-eight hours in some cases. You can sleep on it whenever you want to though. 

Once your mattress has reached the point where it appears to be fluffy and comfy, you can feel confident sleeping on it, and this typically occurs on the very first night.

### **Will A Memory Foam Mattress Return To Its Original Shape After Being Rolled?**

Yes, it will, though it may take a few hours for it to get back to its original size. 

Memory foam conforms to the shape of the body in response to heat and pressure, which helps in distributing the weight of the body evenly.

As soon as the pressure is removed, it reverts back to its original shape. Memory foam provides excellent comfort thanks to these qualities.

## **Summary**

We hope that by following the steps outlined in this helpful do-it-yourself guide, the process of [moving](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-move-a-mattress-alone.html/) or disposing of a mattress will be much easier for you. 

Remember that this method is only suitable for storing foam mattresses, so if you have another type, such as latex, you shouldn’t try this as it may cause damage.  

Compressing and rolling up an innerspring is a bad idea at any time.

When it comes to folding up hybrid mattresses, it is best to get recommendations from the firm that makes the mattresses; while some brands might hold up well during this procedure, others might not.
