## 11 Steps: Mattress Drying Process (Step-by-Step Guide)

* * *

### 1\. Remove all bedding:

Start by removing all bedding from the mattress, including sheets, blankets, and mattress protectors. Wash and dry them separately.

### 2\. Assess the damage:

Determine the extent of the moisture. If it's just a small spill, you may be able to simply blot it dry with a towel. If the mattress is soaked, you'll need to follow the steps below.

### 3\. Blot excess moisture:

Use clean, dry towels or absorbent cloths to blot as much excess moisture as possible. Press firmly on the wet area to help absorb the water. Replace the towels as they become saturated.

### 4\. Move the mattress:

If possible, move the mattress to a well-ventilated area, such as a covered outdoor space or a room with open windows and good air circulation. This will help the drying process.

### 5\. Vacuum with a wet-dry vacuum:

If you have access to a wet-dry vacuum, use it to extract as much moisture as possible from the mattress. Make multiple passes over the wet areas to remove as much water as you can.

### 6\. Use fans and dehumidifiers:

Set up fans and a dehumidifier to help speed up the drying process. Point the fans directly at the wet areas of the mattress and run them continuously. The dehumidifier will help to remove moisture from the air, making it easier for the mattress to dry.

### 7\. Apply baking soda:

Baking soda is an excellent moisture absorber and can help to speed up the drying process. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda onto the wet areas of the mattress, and let it sit for at least a few hours or overnight. Vacuum up the baking soda once the mattress has dried.

### 8\. Use a hairdryer (optional):

If the mattress is still damp after using fans and a dehumidifier, you can use a hairdryer on the lowest heat setting to help dry it further. Hold the hairdryer at least 6 inches away from the mattress and move it in a sweeping motion over the damp areas. Be cautious not to overheat the mattress or hold the hairdryer too close, as this can damage the materials.

### 9\. Flip and rotate the mattress:

To ensure even drying, flip and rotate the mattress every few hours during the drying process. This will also help to prevent mold and mildew from forming.

### 10\. Inspect for mold and mildew:

Once the mattress is completely dry, check for any signs of mold or mildew. If you notice any, clean the area with a mild detergent and water, and allow it to dry completely before using the mattress again.

### 11\. Replace the bedding:

When the mattress is completely dry, replace the clean, dry bedding, and enjoy a good night's sleep.

Remember, patience is key when drying a wet mattress. It can take anywhere from 24 to 48 hours, or even longer, depending on the extent of the moisture and the drying conditions. It's essential to ensure the mattress is completely dry before using it again to prevent mold and mildew growth.  

## Different Causes of Wetness & How to Dry/Clean Them

There are various reasons why a mattress might become wet, and each scenario requires a specific drying and cleaning technique. Here are some common causes and their corresponding solutions:

### Spills and accidents:

If a drink, food, or other liquid spills on the mattress, immediately blot the area with a clean, dry cloth or towel to remove as much moisture as possible. After blotting, apply a mixture of mild detergent and water to the area and gently scrub with a cloth. Rinse with a damp cloth and then use a [wet-dry vacuum](https://www.nilfisk.com/global/consumer/news-and-articles/why-you-need-a-wet-and-dry-vacuum-cleaner/#:~:text=Wet%20and%20Dry%20Vacuum%20Cleaners,inside%20and%20outside%20your%20home.) or towels to remove excess moisture. Use fans, dehumidifiers, and baking soda as described in the previous answer to dry the mattress thoroughly.

### Urine stains:

For urine stains, blot as much moisture as possible with clean, dry towels. Mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle and apply it to the affected area. Blot again with clean towels. Sprinkle baking soda generously over the area and let it sit for a few hours or overnight. Vacuum up the baking soda, and use fans and a dehumidifier to dry the mattress completely.

### Sweat and body moisture:

If your mattress is damp from sweat or body moisture, remove all bedding and allow the mattress to air out in a well-ventilated area. You can also use a fan to speed up the drying process. If there is a lingering odor, sprinkle baking soda on the mattress, let it sit for a few hours, then vacuum it up.

### Humidity and moisture from the environment:

If your mattress has absorbed moisture from a humid environment, use a dehumidifier in the room to reduce humidity levels. You can also use fans to circulate air around the mattress. If necessary, use the baking soda method to remove any musty odors.

### Flooding or water leaks:

If your mattress has been soaked due to flooding or a water leak, it's important to act quickly. Remove the mattress from the affected area, and use a wet-dry vacuum to extract as much water as possible. Set up fans and a dehumidifier to speed up the drying process. If the mattress was exposed to contaminated water, it's best to consult a professional cleaning service or consider replacing the mattress.

### Mold and mildew:

If mold or mildew is present on your mattress, it's crucial to clean and dry it thoroughly to prevent health issues. Mix a solution of equal parts water and rubbing alcohol or water and mild detergent, and scrub the affected areas with a cloth. Rinse with a damp cloth and use a wet-dry vacuum to remove excess moisture. Dry the mattress completely using fans and a dehumidifier. If the mold or mildew is extensive or persistent, it might be necessary to replace the mattress.

Remember, always ensure the mattress is completely dry before using it again to prevent further issues. In cases of severe damage or contamination, it's best to consult a professional or consider replacing the mattress.
