## 2\. The Dreamfoam Essential by Brooklyn Bedding

### What our testers are saying:

The Dreamfoam mattress is probably the best "bang for your buck" mattress on the market. Not only is the level of quality and materials used very high end, it is also 100% made in the USA at their factory in Arizona, which is pretty much unheard of at this price point. The mattresse uses a high density support foam on the bottom layer to support even the heaviest of sleepers and then provides a luxurious high quality layer of memory foam on top for comfort and pressure relief. The cover is very soft and easily unzips for washing/cleaning. This mattress comes in a [variety of thickness options](https://www.abedderworld.com/mattress-thickness-guide-everything-you-need-to-know.html/) and sizes (we recommend at least a 10" thickness for a king size that you will be sleeping on every night.

## 3\. The Plank

\

### What our testers are saying:

The Plank is made by Brooklyn Bedding and is 100% made in the USA in their factory in Arizona. The Plank Hybrid mattress is made specifically for those sleepers who prefer an [extra firm](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-extra-firm-mattress.html/) sleeping surface, which is great for anyone with back pain. It is by far the best mattress on the market for people who love a firm mattress. If you buy mattresses and constantly are wanting them firmer then this mattress was made for you. The Plank hybrid mattress takes firm to the next level and offers a [2 sided design](https://www.abedderworld.com/double-sided-mattress.html/) with a standard firm and extra firm surface. They also offer an option “cooling layer” that you can add on top to help keep you sleeping cooler during hot months. At just over [1000](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-king-mattress-under-1000.html/) for a queen size, the price point is very competitive. Putting a firm mattress on a platform style bed is going to maximize its firmness level because it takes away any give or bounce that a box spring would add.

## Reasons to Buy A Mattress Made in the USA

### Quality Materials

One of the biggest advantages of USA-made mattresses is the quality of the materials used in their construction. [American manufacturers](https://www.usalovelist.com/made-in-usa-furniture/) are held to strict [quality control standards](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-made-usa-standard), which means that the materials used in their products are of a higher quality than those used in imported mattresses.

For example, many American-made mattresses are constructed using premium materials like organic cotton, natural latex, and memory foam. These materials are not only more comfortable than their cheaper counterparts, but they are also more durable. A high-quality mattress is a long-term investment, and by choosing a USA-made mattress, you can be sure that you are getting a product that will last for years to come.

In addition, many USA-made mattresses are manufactured using eco-friendly materials. Many American manufacturers are committed to sustainability and are dedicated to reducing their impact on the environment. This is not always the case with imported mattresses, which may be made from cheaper, less eco-friendly materials.

### Better Working Conditions

Another advantage of USA-made mattresses is the working conditions under which they are produced. American manufacturers are required to comply with strict labor laws that protect workers' rights and ensure fair wages. This means that workers in American mattress factories are treated better and are paid more than those in other countries.

In contrast, many imported mattresses are made in factories with poor working conditions, where workers are paid very low wages and may not have access to basic rights and protections. By buying a USA-made mattress, you can be confident that you are supporting fair labor practices and helping to promote better working conditions for workers around the world.

### Better Customer Service

American manufacturers are known for their excellent customer service, with many offering generous warranties and sleep trials. If you have an issue with an American-made mattress, you can usually contact the manufacturer and get a quick and helpful response. This is not always the case with imported mattresses, which may have poor customer service and may not offer warranties or sleep trials.

Many USA-made mattresses come with extended warranties that cover the mattress for a longer period of time. This is a testament to the quality of the materials used in their construction and shows that American manufacturers stand behind their products.

### Supporting American Jobs

By buying a USA-made mattress, you are also [supporting American jobs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/). The mattress industry is a [significant employer in the United States](https://theroundup.org/mattress-industry-statistics/#:~:text=US%20mattress%20industry%20statistics%20reveal,over%20the%20last%205%20years.), and by buying an American-made mattress, you are helping to support jobs in this industry.

Many American manufacturers are also small businesses, and buying their products helps to support the local economy. In contrast, buying imported mattresses often means supporting foreign companies that may not have the same commitment to American jobs and the local economy.

### Customizable Options

USA-made mattresses often offer more customizable options than imported mattresses. American manufacturers often allow customers to choose the size, firmness, and other features of their mattress, which means that you can get a mattress that is tailored to your specific needs and preferences.

In contrast, imported mattresses often come in standard sizes and firmness levels, which may not be suitable for everyone. By buying an American-made mattress, you can get a mattress that is designed to meet your individual needs and provide you with the best possible sleep experience.

### Warranty and Return Policies

USA-made mattresses often come with generous warranty and return policies. American manufacturers are confident in the quality of their products and offer warranties that reflect this confidence.

## Final Thoughts

As you can see, it is the American engineering used to make these mattresses that makes them so good.

Many of these mattresses are considered the best internationally, showing that you don’t have to look for inferior products if you want to support US innovation.

Equally many of these products seek to use as many eco friendly manufacturing processes and products as they can, also showing that the US is full of eco friendly products that also don’t sacrifice quality at all.

We hope that in this article you can find the right US made mattress for you that can help support your back and sleeping habits as much as it can support US industry and eco friendly practices.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **What Is A Bed In A Box?**

Mattresses are one thing that can really affect our sleep and, in turn, our lives. Yet, for a long time many people will avoid getting a mattress due to the awkward nature of having to transport and maneuver it into your bedroom.

A bed in a box attempts to resolve this issue, helping people get better sleep, by delivering a mattress that is rolled up into a box.

This doesn’t affect quality too much, albeit with some coiling restrictions, and can simply be unraveled in your bedroom easily, usually with a period of time for it to return to its natural shape, ready to use.
