# 12 Sturdy Bed Frames For "Active" Couples: (We Tested Dozens)

A [bed frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_frame) should hold up to everyday [bedroom activities](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/bedroom-activities-sleep). It shouldn't slam, squeak or rock back and forth. It shouldn't require you to tighten it every few days. It should be sturdy and solid.

Unfortunately, too many bed frames on the market are crafted poorly and are not ideal for [heavier individuals](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320917) or active couples.

If you are looking for a sturdy bed frame that was meant to hold up to to your "active" lifestyle then you have come to the right place. We have tested, researched and reviewed all of the best bed frames sold today and have put together a list of the absolute sturdiest beds on the market. 

## Need a durable mattress as well?

We have torn open over 500K mattresses from every manufacturer. See our top picks for the most durable mattresses on the market.

## Features to look for when purchasing a sturdy bedframe

One would assume that all bed frames would be sturdy. Unfortunately this is not the case. In fact, the majority of bed frames are not ideal for bedroom activities. When you are shopping, there are some features you should look for to ensure you purchase a bed frame that won't rock, [squeak](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-fix-a-squeaky-bed-frame.html/) or sway. 

Features to look for in a sturdy bed frame: 

- **Quality Material** - Solid thick wood or steel frames are ideal. You can tell pretty quickly by looking at a bed frame if it is well made or not. Frames from Ikea or Walmart look much different than those you find at a higher end furniture store. 

- **Sturdy Wide Feet-** The feet of a bed frame should be thick and sturdy. If you purchase a frame with thin feet it is much more likely the frame will rock or sway on uneven ground. 

- **Comes in Larger Pieces. The Less Assembly the Better -** We have all purchased something cheap from Ikea or Walmart that arrives in 100 pieces. Generally you put the piece together and within the next year it is wobbling or slowly coming apart. If you are looking for a sturdy bed frame you want to find one that comes in the least amount of pieces possible. The larger the pieces the less room for movement and the more solid the entirety of the bed will be. For example if you somehow made a [bed frame](https://www.abedderworld.com/grey-bed-frame.html/) out of one single piece of steel you would likely have no movement at all because you have no "joints" or seams to create any give.

## How to get rid of an old bed frame?

If you are purchasing a [bed frame online](https://www.abedderworld.com/alternatives-for-thuma-beds.html/), chances are you probably have an old one to get rid of. Unfortunately most of the [online mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-a-bed-in-a-box-worth-it.html/) retailers will not take your old bed away for you. Luckily we do just that! A Bedder World has mattress disposal and recycling services throughout the country. You can [book a pick up online,](https://www.abedderworld.com/book-online/) put your items outside and let us take care of the rest!

Overall, finding a sturdy bed frame is simple but generally means purchasing a more expensive higher quality product. Any of the ikea or mosrt Amazon products are going to be cheaply made and will squeak and creak as they loosen and get older. Any of the bed frames listed above will be great for sexually active couples or heavier sleepers to enjoy.
