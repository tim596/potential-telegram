## What can you use instead of a mattress?

There are a variety of different types of beds and pads that you can use as alternatives to a standard mattress. Standard mattresses have become mainstream in western culture but there are plenty of cultures who prefer not to use them. Below are a few different types of sleeping products you can use as mattress alternatives. 

**Japanese floor futon:** A Japanese floor futon, also called a Shikibuton or Futon, is an all organic wool and [cotton mattress pad](https://www.abedderworld.com/cotton-comforter.html/) that is meant to be put [directly on the floor](https://www.abedderworld.com/8-best-floor-mattress-options-of-2020.html/). This type of mattress has been used by Asian cultures for centuries and is actually argued by many to be a healthier more supportive way to sleep. Floor futons are about half the price of a standard mattress. 

**Murphy bed:** A [Murphy bed](https://www.abedderworld.com/murphy-bed-mattress.html/) is a bed that folds up into a piece of furniture when not in use. This is great for smaller apartments or for people who want to have additional sleeping space for guests that doesn't take up a lot of room. Murphy beds come in a variety of styles to meet the decor and space of any home. 

**Cots/Folding beds:** [Folding beds or cots](https://www.abedderworld.com/fold-up-bed.html/) are great ways to have a comfortable sleeping option without taking up a lot of space. A [cot](https://www.abedderworld.com/cot-mattress.html/) can fold down extremely small and be stored in a closet when not in use. 

**Camping pad:** A [camping pad](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-camping-bed.html/) is meant for sleeping on the floor while camping but can also be a great way to sleep on the floor at home as an alternative to a mattress. Camping pads are easy to roll up and store and a quality one will actually provide sufficient padding for an every night sleeper. 

**Air mattress**: An air mattress is another mattress alternative that most people are familiar with. While there are many low quality air mattresses on the market, if you purchase a quality one you will find that they have come a long way over the years. 

## Is it better to sleep without a mattress?

Whether you use a mattress or not is all about personal preference. Some experts actually say that sleeping on the floor with minimal padding is healthier for your back and spine than sleeping on a mattress. If you enjoy a firmer surface you may enjoy sleeping on the floor or one of the floor sleeping options on this list. While western culture has pushed spending thousands on a quality mattress, the truth is there are alternatives that can provide the comfort you need for a great nights sleep without a traditional mattress. For proof just look at other cultures and how they sleep throughout the world. 

## Can a sleeping bag replace a mattress?

Sleeping bags do provide some amount of padding when sleeping on the floor, however, we would not say that they fully replace the use of a mattress. If you plan to sleep in a sleeping bag every night we would recommend a camping pad or a Japanese floor mattress to put underneath for adding some comfort and pressure relief. 

## Are there healthy alternatives to mattresses?

Many people are concerned about the foams in their mattresses and opt for a healthier sleeping option. If you are looking for a healthy alternative to the traditional mattress we would recommend a [Japanese futon](https://www.abedderworld.com/futon-mattresses.html/) mattress. Many futons are made with cotton and wool and are 100% organic and [hypoallergenic](https://www.abedderworld.com/hypoallergenic-mattress.html/). The Japanese have been using them to sleep on for centuries and prefer them over a mattress. 

## Can you make a homemade mattress?

If you are looking to make a homemade mattress instead of buying one, there are a variety of options that DIYers have come up with over the years. [Here is a link to a page with a variety of homemade mattress options](https://www.littleloveliesbyallison.com/diy-mattress-ideas/).
