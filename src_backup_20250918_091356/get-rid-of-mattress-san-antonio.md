### Overview: Mattress Disposal In San Antonio

Unfortunately, San Antonio does not have too many mattress disposal services at your disposal. While San Antonio is working on setting up a mattress recycling center for residential drop-offs, they do not currently have one available. This means that the options for mattress disposal within the city are limited. Besides taking their items to the [local landfills,](https://311.sanantonio.gov/kb/docs/articles/graffiti-and-waste-collection/disposal-optionsprivate-landfills) residents have to choose between hiring a provate company to pick up their mattress items or utilizing the cities bulky waste collection options. The [donation](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) centers in the San Antonio area do not accpet mattresses for the most part. If your mattress is less than 5 years old and has no stains, rips or damage, you may be able to find a donation center or charity to take it but do not expect this to be a "go-to" disposal option. Below we have listed 5 options for getting rid of your mattress or [box spring](_wp_link_placeholder) in the San Antonio area. This list includes options from local pick up services to drop off options and DIY ideas.

## Option #5: DIY Mattress Recycling Project

![](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-768x429.png)

If you are a DIY and like taking on projects why not recycle your mattress yourself. This could be a great way to teach your kids about being resourceful or just a fun way to save some money and the environment. By recycling your mattress you can save on average 26sq.ft. of landfill space. We have a great step-by-step blog post on [how to break down and recycle your own mattress.](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/) Along with another post on [how to recycle your box spring yourself](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-box-spring/). To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for the foam.
