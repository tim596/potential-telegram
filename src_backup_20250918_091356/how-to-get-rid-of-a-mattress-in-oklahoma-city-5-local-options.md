## How Do You Know You Need A New Mattress?

On average, mattresses should be replaced every 8 years. Some mattresses will have a longer lifespan than this, and some will be shorter.

There are some ways that you can test whether or not you need a new mattress. The main test will be how it feels when you are sleeping on your mattress.

If you are able to get quality rest on your mattress and it feels comfortable and supportive, then it is likely not ready to be replaced. 

However, if you feel sore or achy when you have slept on your mattress, it likely needs replacing.

## Is My Mattress In Good Enough Shape To Be Donated?
