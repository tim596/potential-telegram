Donating a mattress in Omaha, Nebraska, can be an excellent way to give it a second life while helping someone in need. Keep in mind that donated mattresses must be clean, free of damage, and free of any bed bugs or pests. The Stephen Center works with the community to help with homelessness, addiction and mental health. They accept all kinds of furniture donations including mattresses in gently-used condition.

We recommend contacting them beforehand to confirm their acceptance policy for mattresses and whether they you want to set a pick-up services or drop-off.

We always recommend recycling or donating a mattress for disposing of it in the landfill. Mattresses are hard to breakdown and take up a lot of unnecessary landfill space. BUT if those other options are available to you then taking it to the local Pheasant Point landfill is another option.

_We recommend looking at their website and checking any updated fees and regulations for mattresses. Many landfills across the country are beginning to implement strict laws for mattress disposal, which is not the case yet in Omaha but it could be at some point in the future._

### FEES:

#### Special Handling Fees will apply to uncovered or unsecured loads and other additional services provided.Â

## Option #4: Sell it on [Omaha Craigslist](https://omaha.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

There are a lot of people out there looking to get a lightly used mattress for a discount rather than spend hundreds or thousands on a new one. This makes the used mattress market surprisingly hot. If your mattress is in decent condition and could get a few more years of use you should consider selling it or giving it away on an online marketplace.

Be sure to take some nice clean photos and to ensure potential buyers that your bed is free from bed bugs and stains. Happy selling!

_Always remember, it is important to be smart when meeting anyone online and we always recommend having other people around when meeting or going to a public location._

If you want to take on a small project and save some money and the environment, you can recycle your mattress yourself. ([Full guide here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)). Believe it or not, about 90% of the materials inside your mattress can be recycled and reused at businesses in Omaha.

Start by tearing off the cover. Then separate the foam and metal inside. The metal springs can be dropped at a local scrap metal yard where they will weigh it and give you some cash for it. As for the foam, you can call around to local carpet manufacturers to see who will take used foam. Many of them will gladly accept it, as it can be shredded and used to make carpet padding.
