      text: "Living near the University of North Dakota campus, we deal with a lot of student turnover in our apartment complex. When our upstairs neighbors graduated and left their mattresses behind, the property manager recommended this removal service. They responded immediately during the busy May move-out period, arrived the same day we called, and efficiently removed two twin mattresses and a futon without any hassle. The crew understood the time pressures of university housing and worked quickly to clear everything out before the next tenants moved in. The $295 total for three items was completely reasonable, especially considering they saved us from having to coordinate with multiple waste management companies or figure out the city's collection requirements ourselves."
