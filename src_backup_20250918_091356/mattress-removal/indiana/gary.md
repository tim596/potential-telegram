    - text: "Called them for my place in Miller Beach near the lake. They knew exactly where to go - had to navigate around the steel mill traffic but got there on time. 155 for the queen mattress, done in 15 minutes."

      neighborhood: "Miller Beach"
    - text: "Live downtown near the IU campus, tiny apartment with weird stairs. These guys brought the right equipment and didn't scratch up the walls. Way easier than dealing with Republic Services."

      neighborhood: "Downtown Gary"
    - text: "Scheduled pickup during my lunch break from the plant. They worked fast - knew they had to beat the 3pm shift change traffic. Professional crew, fair price at 125 bucks."

faqs:
  - question: "Do you really recycle every mattress you pick up in Gary?"
    answer: "Absolutely! We've recycled over 1 million mattresses nationwide with 100% recycling rate over 13+ years. Every Gary mattress is processed through certified facilities - springs become construction materials, foam becomes carpet padding, and fabrics enter textile recycling streams."
  - question: "How quickly can you pick up from Gary's different neighborhoods?"
    answer: "Next-day service is standard throughout Gary, from Miller Beach lakefront to downtown areas and steel plant neighborhoods. We coordinate efficiently around U.S. Steel shift changes and industrial traffic patterns that affect local access."
  - question: "Can you handle Gary's varied housing from lakefront homes to plant worker housing?"
    answer: "Yes, our 13+ years serving Northwest Indiana means we're experienced with everything from Miller Beach lakefront properties to traditional worker housing in Ambridge Mann and downtown apartments near IU Northwest. We adapt to each area's specific access requirements."
  - question: "What's included in Gary's $125 starting price?"
    answer: "Complete service including pickup, Lake County-compliant disposal, transportation, and guaranteed 100% recycling. Additional charges apply for stairs ($10/flight) or carries over 75 feet. No landfill waste ever."
  - question: "Do you work around steel mill schedules and industrial traffic?"
    answer: "Absolutely! We understand Gary's industrial calendar including U.S. Steel shift changes, plant maintenance schedules, and heavy truck traffic patterns. Our 13+ years experience includes flexible scheduling around industrial operations and worker housing needs."
  - question: "How does your service differ from Republic Services' bulk pickup?"
    answer: "While Republic Services allows one bulk item per weekly collection, items typically go to landfills. Our specialized service ensures 100% recycling, provides exact scheduling, and eliminates coordination with municipal collection limitations while supporting Gary's environmental goals."
  - question: "Are you licensed for Lake County mattress disposal and recycling?"
    answer: "Yes, we're fully licensed Lake County haulers working with approved contractors. Unlike basic disposal services that may use landfills, we ensure every mattress reaches certified recycling facilities, supporting Gary's redevelopment efforts with our proven 1+ million mattress recycling track record."
  - question: "Can you pick up bed frames and box springs too?"
    answer: "Yes! Our 3-piece service ($180) includes complete bedroom set removal with professional disassembly. Everything is recycled through our proven processes that have handled over 1 million mattresses nationwide over 13+ years."
