localRegulations: "Fort Wayne residents use the city's 311 system for bulk pickup with 2-day advance scheduling and plastic wrapping requirements for mattresses. Without Indiana's Bye Bye Mattress program, residents rely on city bulk service or private options. Our next-day service eliminates advance scheduling delays while providing 100% recycling that Fort Wayne's manufacturing and tech workforce values."
