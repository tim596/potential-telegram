localRegulations: "Unlike Frederick County's Solid Waste Division which requires residents to transport mattresses to the Reichs Ford Road facility during specific operating hours and meet preparation standards, our service operates independently. The county system demands advance coordination and personal transport logistics that conflict with biotech research schedules, federal commuting patterns, and historic district preservation activities."

    - text: "Living in a house from 1847 comes with challenges most people don't think about. Every delivery, every service has to navigate narrow doorways and steep stairs that weren't designed for modern furniture. When I needed my old mattress removed, I was honestly worried about potential damage to our historic walls and flooring. The team arrived with all the right protective materials and took their time maneuvering everything safely. They clearly had experience with older architecture. Made the whole process stress-free, which is saying something for a preservation district homeowner!"
