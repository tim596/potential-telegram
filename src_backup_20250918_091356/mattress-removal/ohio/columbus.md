      text: "We live in a high-rise condo downtown and needed our old mattresses removed before our new bedroom set arrived. This service was a lifesaver during our busy work schedules at Nationwide. The crew arrived exactly on time during our lunch break, handled both our queen mattress and box spring professionally, and completed everything in under twenty minutes. The $165 total was completely worth avoiding the hassle of scheduling through the city's 311 system and trying to coordinate bulk pickup ourselves. They understood that downtown living means tight schedules and building restrictions, making the whole process seamless for busy professionals like us who work in the financial district."

  heroDescription: "Eco-friendly mattress disposal serving Ohio State University students, downtown professionals, and Columbus residents. Part of our nationwide network that has recycled over 1 million mattresses, we provide next-day pickup with transparent pricing "
  
  aboutService: "We provide professional mattress removal throughout Columbus with next-day pickup  Our service eliminates the complexity of Franklin County's waste system, providing convenient door-to-door pickup instead of navigating the city's 311 scheduling requirements and bulk collection limitations that don't include regular mattress pickup. We coordinate with Columbus's diverse schedules, from Ohio State University move-out periods and downtown corporate hours to the unique needs of historic neighborhoods like German Village. Our team understands Columbus's character as both a major university town and state capital, handling logistics for any area from campus housing to downtown high-rises to historic districts with narrow streets. Every mattress we collect joins our nationwide network that has successfully diverted over 1 million mattresses from landfills, with 80% of materials recovered for reuse including steel springs, foam, and fabric components."

  serviceAreasIntro: "We provide mattress pickup service throughout all Columbus neighborhoods across multiple ZIP codes, coordinating logistics for each area's unique characteristics. Our team navigates narrow brick streets in German Village just as efficiently as modern downtown high-rises and university housing complexes, providing the same professional service regardless of location. We schedule pickups around Columbus's diverse schedules, accommodating Ohio State academic calendars, downtown business hours, and residential preferences to ensure convenient service for all residents."

  regulationsCompliance: "We handle all waste disposal challenges so Columbus residents don't have to navigate the city's complex bulk collection system or call (614) 645-3111 to schedule through the 311 Customer Service Center. Our licensed service eliminates the hassle of coordinating with the Division of Refuse Collection and their scheduling requirements for bulk items, plus the potential need to wrap upholstered items in plastic depending on your area. While Franklin County Landfill accepts mattresses at $39.75 per ton, our service eliminates transport logistics and facility fees. Our team maintains all necessary permits and insurance coverage, providing compliant mattress removal throughout Columbus's diverse neighborhoods from university housing to state government districts."

  environmentalImpact: "Our mattress recycling service supports Columbus's environmental initiatives by diverting waste from Franklin County's landfill system. As part of our nationwide network that has recycled over 1 million mattresses, we ensure 80% of components get recovered for reuse rather than adding to local landfill capacity. Steel springs return to manufacturing processes that support Columbus's growing automotive sector including Honda's expanded operations and Intel's new $20 billion semiconductor facility, while foam components become carpet padding for Ohio's construction industry. Fabric materials get repurposed into new products, reducing textile waste that would otherwise burden SWACO's waste management system. This responsible disposal approach helps preserve Ohio's natural resources while providing Columbus residents, OSU students, and downtown professionals with a convenient, eco-friendly alternative to navigating Franklin County's disposal requirements."

  howItWorksScheduling: "Call or book online for next-day service throughout Columbus and Franklin County. We coordinate with Ohio State academic schedules, downtown business hours, and residential preferences."

  howItWorksService: "Our licensed team provides efficient pickup service throughout Columbus, handling all county disposal requirements so you don't have to. We coordinate logistics for any neighborhood layout and work around your schedule."

  howItWorksDisposal: "Every mattress joins our nationwide recycling network that has processed over 1 million mattresses. Materials go to approved facilities where components get recovered for reuse, providing Columbus residents with responsible disposal that supports environmental sustainability."
