      text: "We live near Coventry Village where our teenagers love the eclectic shops and street art scene. When we upgraded to a new bedroom set last month, this mattress removal service made the process incredibly easy. They scheduled around our busy week of school activities and my husband's commute to University Circle, arriving exactly when promised on Saturday morning. The crew professionally removed both our queen mattress and box spring while being respectful of our neighborhood's artistic character. The $165 total was much more convenient than trying to wrap everything in plastic and coordinate with Cleveland's bulk pickup system ourselves. They understood that families in Cleveland Heights value both efficiency and community respect."
