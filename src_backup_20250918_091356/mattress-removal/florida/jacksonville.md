# Local regulations content
localRegulations: "Jacksonville operates under City of Jacksonville Solid Waste Division regulations providing free curbside bulk waste pickup every other week for residential customers. Mattresses must be placed curbside by 6:00 a.m. on assigned collection days with no wrapping requirements, though wrapping is recommended for sanitation. The city's Trail Ridge Landfill at 5110 U.S. Hwy 301S in Baldwin accepts mattresses for disposal fees of $30.30 per ton. Republic Services and WM provide additional waste management throughout Jacksonville but require special arrangements for mattress disposal. Municipal regulations prohibit placing mattresses in standard dumpsters without provider approval, with potential fines for violations."
