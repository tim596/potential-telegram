faqs:
  - question: "Can you work around University move-out deadlines?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We understand the May 18th residence hall deadline and provide next-day service during peak academic periods when municipal bulk pickup is overwhelmed."
  - question: "Do you serve both Champaign and Urbana?"
    answer: "Yes, we serve the entire Champaign-Urbana metro area including all student housing areas, faculty neighborhoods, and residential districts."
  - question: "How quickly can you schedule pickup during semester transitions?"
    answer: "We offer next-day service year-round, including during high-demand periods like spring move-out, summer session changes, and fall move-in."
  - question: "What if my mattress is in a dorm or student apartment?"
    answer: "We coordinate with residence halls, student apartments, and Greek housing for proper removal, handling any building access requirements."
  - question: "Can you pick up from graduate student housing or faculty areas?"
    answer: "Yes, we serve all University of Illinois housing including graduate apartments, faculty neighborhoods, and staff residential areas."
  - question: "How do you handle recycling compared to bulk pickup?"
    answer: "Unlike Republic Services bulk pickup that typically goes to landfill, we recycle 100% of mattresses - steel springs become new metal, foam becomes carpet padding, fabric becomes insulation."
