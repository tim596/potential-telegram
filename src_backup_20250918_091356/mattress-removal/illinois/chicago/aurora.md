    - text: "Our Orchard Village apartment required coordinated pickup through building management. The team handled our king mattress and box spring perfectly, navigating the Indian Trail complex's parking restrictions and elevator schedule. Knowing it's being recycled instead of landfilled makes the $155 worth it."

    - text: "Living downtown near the Paramount Theatre in one of those historic buildings with narrow staircases - wasn't sure how they'd manage our memory foam mattress. Team was incredible, used proper equipment and had everything wrapped for Aurora's regulations. Love that they recycle 100% of what they collect."

  heroDescription: "Aurora's premier mattress recycling service with over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide. Serving Illinois' second-largest city across 18+ neighborhoods from historic Stolp Island to Indian Trail developments."
  aboutService: |
    <p>As Illinois' second-largest city with 175,795 residents, Aurora presents unique mattress removal challenges that our experienced team navigates daily. From the historic Art Deco buildings on Stolp Island near the Paramount Theatre to the modern Orchard Village apartments on Indian Trail Road, we understand Aurora's diverse housing landscape spans 36 distinct neighborhoods across both sides of the Fox River.</p>
    
    <p>Our service adapts to Aurora's housing diversity - 64.7% homeownership with properties ranging from Prairie School architecture downtown to newer townhomes in Sugar Grove and Montgomery. We coordinate with the Hollywood Casino district's high-rises, work around Aurora University's academic calendar, and handle everything from Victorian homes with narrow staircases to contemporary apartments with freight elevator requirements.</p>
    
    <p>Every mattress we collect in Aurora joins our nationwide recycling achievement of over 1 million mattresses diverted from landfills. Licensed for Kane County operations, we ensure 100% recycling of every pickup while meeting Aurora's municipal waste regulations and supporting the city's environmental commitment.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "From the Fox River's scenic Stolp Island to the expanding residential corridors along Indian Trail and beyond to Montgomery, our Aurora service network spans the city's complete 36-neighborhood footprint:"
  regulationsCompliance: "Aurora requires mattresses be wrapped in plastic before pickup - a regulation we exceed through our comprehensive preparation process. As licensed Kane County haulers, we work within Aurora's waste management framework while ensuring every mattress reaches certified recycling facilities rather than local landfills."
  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Aurora's 175,795 residents generate significant mattress waste, but our recycling-first approach ensures zero Aurora mattresses reach landfills. As part of our 1+ million mattresses recycled nationwide, every Aurora pickup contributes to environmental protection through comprehensive materials recovery.</p>
    
    <p>We partner with Kane County facilities and regional recycling centers to process Aurora's mattresses into valuable materials - steel springs become new construction materials, memory foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabric components enter textile recycling streams. This circular economy approach supports Aurora's sustainability goals while reducing the environmental impact of the city's 65,128 households.</p>
    
    <p>Aurora University students and all city residents benefit from our environmentally responsible disposal that keeps mattress materials in productive use rather than occupying Kane County landfill space.</p>
