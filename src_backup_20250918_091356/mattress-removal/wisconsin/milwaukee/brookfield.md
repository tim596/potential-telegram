During busy moving seasons, the county facility often reaches capacity on Saturdays."

  heroDescription: "Professional mattress removal serving Brookfield families and homeowners. With over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide, we provide reliable next-day service throughout Milwaukee's western communities."
  aboutService: |
    <p>Getting rid of old mattresses in Brookfield means dealing with Waukesha County's disposal requirements and coordinating around GFL's regular collection schedule. We handle both challenges for you. Our service has recycled over 1 million mattresses through our nationwide network, bringing that experience directly to your door whether you live in the rolling hills near Hidden Lake or the established neighborhoods around Garvendale.</p>

    <p>Brookfield residents often call us when they're upgrading bedrooms, moving between homes, or clearing out guest rooms. We work around work schedules and family routines, navigating the winding subdivision streets that make this area unique. No need to wrestle mattresses into your car or wait weeks for bulk pickup - we come to you and handle everything the same day.</p>

    <p>Our team knows Brookfield's layout well, from the Tudor-style homes in the older sections to the newer developments spreading west toward Waukesha. We coordinate pickup times that work for busy families, handle all the heavy lifting, and take care of proper recycling through Wisconsin-approved facilities.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "We serve all of Brookfield, from the commercial areas around Sendik's Towne Centre to residential neighborhoods throughout the rolling hills and established subdivisions."
  regulationsCompliance: "GFL won't pick up mattresses with regular Wednesday collection in Brookfield, leaving residents to haul items to the Waukesha County facility themselves or wait weeks for bulk pickup scheduling. We eliminate this hassle entirely - no loading mattresses into your SUV, no weekend trips to Sentry Drive, no dealing with disposal fees. Our team handles pickup directly from your home and manages all county disposal requirements."
  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Every mattress we collect from Brookfield homes gets processed through our recycling network, where steel springs, foam, and fabric are separated and reused in manufacturing. This keeps about 65 pounds of material out of Wisconsin landfills for each mattress - a meaningful difference when multiplied across thousands of disposals annually.</p>

    <p>Wisconsin residents appreciate environmentally responsible options, and our recycling process delivers real results. About 85% of each mattress gets diverted from waste streams and turned into new products, from carpet padding to steel products.</p>

    <p>For families who care about reducing waste, our service provides a simple way to dispose of mattresses responsibly. Instead of wondering whether your old mattress will end up in a landfill, you know it's being processed properly through established Wisconsin recycling channels.</p>
  howItWorksScheduling: "We offer flexible scheduling that works with your routine - morning appointments before work, afternoon pickups while kids are at school, or weekend service when it's most convenient."
  howItWorksService: "Our team comes equipped for Brookfield's varied housing - from ranch-style homes to multi-story houses with stairs. We navigate the winding streets easily and handle all the lifting and maneuvering safely."
