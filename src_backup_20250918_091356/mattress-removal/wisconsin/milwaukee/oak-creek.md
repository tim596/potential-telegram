Residents must schedule separate bulk pickup, transport items to the city recycling facility themselves, or arrange private disposal. The city's recycling yard has specific policies for bulky items that change seasonally."

  heroDescription: "Professional mattress removal serving Oak Creek residents and businesses. With over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide, we provide reliable next-day service in Milwaukee's lakefront community."
  aboutService: |
    <p>Removing old mattresses in Oak Creek means working around GFL's cart-only collection system that won't accept bulky items curbside. We solve this problem directly. Our service has processed over 1 million mattresses through nationwide recycling networks, bringing that experience to Oak Creek homes from the lakefront near Bender Park to family neighborhoods around Drexel Town Square.</p>

    <p>Oak Creek residents call us when they're upgrading bedrooms, moving into new apartments, or preparing for houseguests. We work around your schedule, whether you live in one of the newer developments along South 27th Street or an established home in historic Carrollville. No wrestling mattresses into your car or waiting weeks for bulk pickup scheduling - we handle everything the same day you call.</p>

    <p>Our team knows Oak Creek well, from navigating the apartment complexes near IKEA to accessing lakefront properties with longer driveways. We coordinate timing that works for busy families and professionals, handle all the lifting safely, and ensure proper disposal through Wisconsin-approved facilities without you dealing with city recycling facility policies.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "We serve all of Oak Creek, from Lake Michigan shoreline properties to I-94 corridor developments, covering every neighborhood in this growing Milwaukee County community."
  regulationsCompliance: "GFL Environmental's cart-only policy means Oak Creek mattresses can't go out with regular garbage pickup. The city recycling facility accepts bulky items but requires residents to transport everything themselves and follow changing seasonal policies. We eliminate this hassle - no loading mattresses into vehicles, no trips to recycling yards, no dealing with facility hours or fees."
  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Oak Creek residents who care about Lake Michigan water quality appreciate responsible mattress disposal that keeps materials out of local waste streams. Our recycling process separates steel springs, foam, and fabric components for reuse in manufacturing, preventing roughly 65 pounds of material per mattress from reaching Wisconsin landfills.</p>

    <p>About 85% of each mattress we collect gets processed into new products through established recycling channels. Steel springs become new metal products, foam turns into carpet padding, and fabric fibers support textile manufacturing - all contributing to circular economy principles that Oak Creek families value.</p>

    <p>For environmentally conscious residents, our service provides a straightforward way to dispose of mattresses responsibly. Instead of wondering whether your old mattress will impact local waste systems, you know it's being processed properly through verified Wisconsin recycling facilities.</p>
  howItWorksScheduling: "Flexible scheduling works around your routine - morning appointments before work, afternoon service while kids are at school, or weekend pickup when it's most convenient for your family."
  howItWorksService: "Our team comes equipped for Oak Creek's mix of housing types, from ground-floor apartments to multi-story homes with stairs. We navigate efficiently and handle all lifting and maneuvering with care."
  howItWorksDisposal: "Your mattress goes straight to Wisconsin-approved recycling facilities where materials get properly separated and processed. We manage all paperwork, fees, and compliance requirements completely."
