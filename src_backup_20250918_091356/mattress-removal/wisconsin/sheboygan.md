  heroDescription: "Professional mattress removal serving Sheboygan's Lake Michigan community. With over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide, we bring reliable service to Wisconsin's historic manufacturing hub."
  aboutService: |
    <p>When you need a mattress removed in Sheboygan, you shouldn't have to coordinate with the city's automated collection restrictions or find time to deal with special disposal programs during Wisconsin's harsh lake winters. We bring the solution directly to you. Our service has processed over 1 million mattresses through our nationwide recycling network, delivering that expertise to your door whether you live in a lakefront condo near the harbor or a suburban home in West Sheboygan.</p>

    <p>Sheboygan residents call us when they're upgrading bedrooms, moving between jobs at major employers like Kohler Company or Acuity Insurance, or preparing vacation rental properties for the busy summer season. We understand this Lake Michigan community's unique rhythm - working around manufacturing shift schedules, coordinating with marina activities during boat season, and planning for the tourism influx that transforms the lakefront each summer.</p>

    <p>Instead of dealing with Midwest Recycling Corporation's scheduling or waiting for the city's large item disposal program, we handle everything directly. Our team knows Sheboygan's character well, from the historic downtown district with its narrow streets to the sprawling lakefront properties that define this "Malibu of the Midwest," and we take care of proper disposal while you focus on work, family, or enjoying everything this lake community offers.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "We serve all of Sheboygan, from North Lake waterfront properties to suburban developments throughout the metro area, covering every neighborhood in Wisconsin's Bratwurst Capital."
  regulationsCompliance: "Sheboygan's automated garbage system specifically excludes large items like mattresses from regular curbside collection, requiring residents to use private services or navigate the city's special disposal programs. We eliminate this complexity entirely - no coordinating with city programs, no dealing with collection fees, no transporting mattresses yourself to designated drop-off locations."
  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Sheboygan's 150-year manufacturing heritage means residents understand the value of processing materials properly rather than simply discarding them. This industrial wisdom extends to responsible mattress disposal that keeps materials productive through established recycling channels. Our process separates steel springs, foam components, and fabric materials for reuse in manufacturing, preventing approximately 65 pounds per mattress from reaching Wisconsin landfills.</p>

    <p>About 85% of each mattress we collect gets transformed into new products through proven recycling partnerships. Steel springs become new metal goods, foam converts to carpet padding, and fabric supports textile manufacturing - maintaining the same productive cycle that built Sheboygan's reputation as a manufacturing center.</p>

    <p>For environmentally conscious residents who appreciate Sheboygan's Lake Michigan location and manufacturing traditions, our service provides a practical way to handle mattress disposal responsibly. You know your old mattress is being processed with the same attention to quality and resource efficiency that defines this community's industrial character.</p>
  howItWorksScheduling: "We offer flexible scheduling that fits Sheboygan's diverse community - manufacturing shift workers, corporate professionals, seasonal business owners, and lake property managers all have different timing needs we can accommodate."
  howItWorksService: "Our team comes equipped for Sheboygan's varied housing landscape - from historic lakefront properties and downtown buildings to modern suburban developments and marina-adjacent condominiums throughout the lake community."
  howItWorksDisposal: "Your mattress goes to Wisconsin-approved processing facilities where materials get properly separated and recycled, upholding the quality standards and environmental responsibility that Sheboygan's manufacturing community values."
