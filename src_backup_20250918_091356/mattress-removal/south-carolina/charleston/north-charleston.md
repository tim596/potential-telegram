After serving our community's aerospace workers, military families, and suburban residents, we've recycled 2,380 mattresses (95,200 pounds) supporting environmental stewardship values. This regional processing reduces transport emissions while creating jobs that serve our diverse economic base including aerospace manufacturing and military operations. Residents contribute to sustainability initiatives that reflect the environmental responsibility values shared throughout our community."
