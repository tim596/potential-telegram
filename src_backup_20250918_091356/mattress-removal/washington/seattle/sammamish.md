localRegulations: "King County charges $30 handling fee per mattress at transfer stations with 6-item daily limits, accepting stained items but no wet mattresses. Sammamish residents currently access Houghton Transfer Station with new Northeast station opening in 2029 requiring county resident verification and specific operating hours. Washington State lacks extended producer responsibility legislation, making private removal essential. Our service eliminates King County facility fees, transfer station transportation requirements, and daily quantity restrictions, providing convenient pickup for busy families, Lake Sammamish waterfront residents, and Eastside professionals throughout Sammamish's neighborhoods spanning from Sahalee golf communities to Adelaide lakefront properties."

  heroDescription: "Professional mattress removal in Sammamish with next-day pickup availability. Serving Lake Sammamish waterfront, Sahalee, Inglewood, and all luxury Eastside neighborhoods. Over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide."
  
  aboutService: "Sammamish residents deserve mattress removal that honors this Eastside community's distinctive character - from Sahalee's championship golf course neighborhoods to Adelaide's historic lakefront charm, Inglewood's family-friendly subdivisions to Klahanie's modern developments, where accomplished professionals and thriving families create a community known for high standards and quality expectations. Our operation serves a unique city where family establishments represent the majority of households, and well-maintained properties create an environment where professional service and attention to detail are essential. King County transfer stations charge $30 handling fees per mattress with 6-item daily limits, requiring county resident verification and transportation to Houghton station pending replacement by Northeast facility in 2029. Our pickup service eliminates these county system complications entirely - no transfer station fees, no facility transportation, no daily quantity restrictions, just professional removal when your schedule permits, whether you're managing professional responsibilities, family activities, home renovations, or property needs throughout Sammamish's distinctive blend of natural beauty and Eastside community living."
