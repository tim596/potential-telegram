  heroDescription: "Professional mattress removal serving Charleston's state capital community. With over 1 million mattresses recycled nationwide, we provide expert service from the Capitol complex to Kanawha Valley neighborhoods."
  aboutService: |
    <p>Charleston stands where the Kanawha and Elk Rivers meet, creating West Virginia's capital city of 46,000 residents nestled in the Allegheny Mountains. From state government workers commuting to the gold-domed Capitol building to CAMC's 8,000+ healthcare employees, this city balances Appalachian heritage with modern demands. We handle moves from East End historic homes to South Hills developments, coordinating around everything from legislative sessions to Mountain Stage recording schedules.</p>

    <p>Our professional mattress removal service has recycled over 1 million mattresses through our nationwide recycling network, bringing this expertise to Charleston's unique rhythm - state workers with government hours, CAMC staff working around-the-clock healthcare shifts, University of Charleston students managing academic schedules, and families living along the scenic river valleys. Whether it's clearing a Capitol complex apartment before a job transfer, removing medical facility furniture during CAMC renovations, or handling student housing transitions at UC, we work within this close-knit community's timeline.</p>

    <p>Skip the hassle of coordinating Charleston's municipal bulk pickup through the Refuse & Recycling Department. We handle direct removal, navigate the city's river valley geography, and ensure proper disposal through Kanawha County facilities - all while you focus on work, family, or enjoying the recreational opportunities at nearby Kanawha State Forest.</p>
  serviceAreasIntro: "Our comprehensive Charleston coverage spans from the Capitol complex to river valley neighborhoods and mountain communities, serving West Virginia's government center and cultural heart."
  regulationsCompliance: "Charleston requires special handling for mattresses through municipal bulk pickup or licensed private services. Our team coordinates with the Charleston Refuse & Recycling Department, manages Kanawha County disposal requirements, and eliminates the scheduling hassles for busy state workers and healthcare professionals."
  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Charleston's environmentally conscious community benefits from advanced mattress recycling practices that support both Appalachian environmental values and state sustainability goals. West Virginia's waste management system processes materials through specialized recycling facilities, recovering steel springs, memory foam components, and textiles for industrial reuse applications.</p>

    <p>Working directly with Charleston city services and state-approved facilities, we ensure 85% of mattress materials avoid landfill disposal through established recycling networks. Our process supports Charleston's environmental stewardship, from Kanawha River watershed protection to preserving the mountain landscapes that define the region.</p>

    <p>For state workers, healthcare professionals, students, and all residents committed to environmental responsibility, our service provides measurable waste diversion that supports both personal and community sustainability goals. Each mattress processed represents approximately 65 pounds of material recovered through approved recycling channels rather than contributing to regional waste concerns.</p>
