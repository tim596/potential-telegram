  heroDescription: "Professional mattress pickup and recycling serving Missouri's first capital city. Part of our nationwide network that has recycled over 1 million mattresses, with next-day service for historic St. Charles riverfront communities."
  aboutService: "Need professional mattress removal in St. Charles? We provide guaranteed recycling through our nationwide network that has processed over 1 million mattresses sustainably. Our service covers every St. Charles neighborhood from Historic Main Street's cobblestone district to Missouri River Bluffs developments. As Missouri's first state capital and county seat, St. Charles residents deserve eco-friendly disposal that matches the community's commitment to historic preservation and riverfront conservation. Whether you're upgrading furniture in a Federal-style historic home, managing inventory for Main Street tourism businesses, or coordinating moves during festival seasons, we ensure your mattresses become valuable raw materials rather than landfill waste.

  serviceAreasIntro: "From Missouri's first capitol building to modern riverfront developments, our eco-friendly pickup reaches every preservation-minded household in this historic river town that welcomes 1.5 million visitors annually:"
  regulationsCompliance: "St. Charles residents benefit from Republic Services' comprehensive waste management through city contract. However, Missouri lacks the mattress stewardship programs operating in California, Oregon, and Connecticut. While the city provides standard recycling collection, specialized mattress recycling requires certified private services. Our documented sustainable disposal supports St. Charles' environmental values and Missouri River watershed protection efforts. With 72,000+ residents in historic districts and modern developments, our eco-friendly approach offers the specialized recycling service that environmentally conscious St. Charles families and businesses seek."
  environmentalImpact: "Our St. Charles service connects to a nationwide recycling network that has diverted over 1 million mattresses from landfills. Each mattress generates approximately 75 pounds of steel for construction projects, 15 pounds of foam for carpet padding production, and fabric for insulation manufacturing. This circular economy approach supports Missouri's environmental goals while providing documentation that Historic Main Street businesses and environmentally conscious residents require. We partner with Missouri River regional processing facilities and county foam recovery networks, creating local economic value from St. Charles' waste stream while supporting the community's commitment to riverfront conservation and historic preservation."
  howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day eco-friendly appointments throughout St. Charles. We coordinate around Lewis & Clark Festival, Christmas Traditions festival, and historic district tourism events that bring 1.5 million annual visitors."
  howItWorksService: "Professional environmental team provides curbside collection using eco-equipped vehicles. We handle Historic Main Street's Federal-style architecture and Missouri River Bluffs developments with equal expertise in sustainable practices and historic preservation protocols."
  howItWorksDisposal: "Your mattress enters our documented recycling network where 90%+ of materials become new products. Steel components go to Missouri regional facilities, while foam supports manufacturing - complete environmental accountability supporting St. Charles' Missouri River conservation values."
