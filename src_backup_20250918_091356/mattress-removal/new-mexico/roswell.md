  regulationsCompliance: "Chaves County and Roswell Municipal Landfill require proper mattress disposal with licensed services to support the city's new 2024 recycling pilot program and Keep Roswell Beautiful initiatives. Our fully licensed service handles all local compliance requirements, from agricultural waste regulations affecting dairy farms to tourism facility documentation needs. Unlike unlicensed disposal or DIY options that risk violations, we provide complete regulatory compliance, proper preparation, and certified facility processing - protecting property managers, dairy operations, and hospitality businesses from potential fines while advancing Roswell's environmental leadership goals."
  environmentalImpact: "Every mattress we remove from Roswell contributes to our 1 million+ mattresses recycled nationwide while supporting the city's environmental leadership and agricultural heritage. In the Pecos Valley, where dairy operations produce over 2 billion pounds of milk annually alongside growing UFO tourism, responsible mattress recycling protects both groundwater quality and desert ecosystems. Our certified network recovers 80%+ of materials - steel springs for manufacturing, foam for agricultural applications, and fabric for industrial use. This keeps mattresses out of Chaves County landfills while supporting Roswell's pioneering 2024 recycling initiatives and Keep Roswell Beautiful programs. Unlike roadside dumping that threatens dairy farm water sources, our professional service actively contributes to environmental stewardship that preserves both Roswell's agricultural legacy and tourism future."
