  heroDescription: "Get your old mattress picked up tomorrow in Santa Fe starting at just $125. Our curbside service works perfectly for the City Different - from historic Plaza area to modern Eldorado. Licensed, reliable, and trusted by Santa Fe families."
  aboutService: "<p>Santa Fe's 7,200-foot elevation creates unique conditions that most mattress removal companies don't understand. The high desert air, intense UV exposure, and dramatic temperature swings between day and night affect how we handle and transport materials. Our curbside pickup service eliminates the hassle of coordinating schedules while ensuring your mattress gets proper high-altitude handling.</p><p>The City Different attracts residents with equally different needs. Government employees cycle through state housing, artists and gallery owners move studios regularly, and seasonal residents need furniture disposal when closing up summer homes. Historic adobe homes in the Eastside require careful navigation of narrow driveways and low doorways, while newer developments in Tierra Contenta and La Tierra have modern access but require understanding the area's unique HOA requirements.</p><p>Our team knows Santa Fe well - we plan efficient routes around Plaza area traffic patterns, work during cooler morning hours at this elevation, and understand the seasonal patterns that affect different neighborhoods. Most importantly, our curbside service means you don't need to be home. Just place your mattress outside on pickup day and we handle everything, including confirmation when collection is complete.</p>"
  serviceAreasIntro: "Our curbside mattress removal covers all Santa Fe neighborhoods, from the historic Plaza district to the growing south side developments. We serve city limits and surrounding Santa Fe County areas with reliable service that understands local conditions."
  regulationsCompliance: "Santa Fe County Solid Waste Management requires all waste haulers to follow high-elevation disposal protocols and cultural preservation guidelines. Unlike national chains that may not understand local requirements, we're fully licensed in Santa Fe County and comply with all city environmental ordinances. We handle load securing for high-altitude transport and follow the city's strict guidelines for historic district access. As your local choice, we navigate all regulatory requirements automatically."
  environmentalImpact: "<p>When you schedule mattress removal in Santa Fe, about 75% of your mattress gets recycled through specialized high-altitude processing networks. The steel springs get separated and sent to regional metal recycling facilities where they become materials for southwestern construction projects. Foam components get processed into insulation products designed for high-elevation homes that face extreme temperature variations.</p><p>Fabric materials get converted into products used throughout New Mexico's art and tourism industries, keeping materials productive within the state's cultural economy. These partnerships support both environmental goals and the local creative industries that make Santa Fe unique, rather than shipping materials to distant processing centers.</p><p>High-altitude operations require specialized techniques that account for reduced air density and UV exposure during transport. Your Santa Fe mattress contributes to a recycling network designed specifically for mountain desert conditions, supporting both environmental sustainability and the local economy in ways that respect the area's cultural and geographic uniqueness.</p>"
