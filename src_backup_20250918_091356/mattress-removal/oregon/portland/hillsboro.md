localRegulations: "Hillsboro residents must comply with Oregon's mattress stewardship program which requires a $22.50 fee per mattress and proper disposal through licensed facilities. Washington County regulations mandate that mattresses cannot go in regular household waste and must be wrapped in plastic before transport to approved disposal sites. Many residents struggle with finding time to navigate limited transfer station hours and proper mattress preparation requirements. Master-planned communities like Orenco Station and Reed's Crossing often have additional HOA restrictions on bulk item placement and pickup timing. Our professional service eliminates these mattress disposal complications by handling all stewardship program compliance, providing proper plastic wrapping and preparation, coordinating with LEED building requirements and community guidelines, and offering flexible scheduling that works around busy family schedules throughout Hillsboro's planned communities."
