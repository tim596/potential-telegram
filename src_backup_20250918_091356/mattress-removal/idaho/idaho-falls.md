  heroDescription: >-
    Professional mattress removal service throughout Idaho Falls' nuclear research and Snake River communities. 
    Next-day curbside pickup with licensed team handling disposal and recycling. 
    Serving INL professionals, Temple View neighborhoods, Greenbelt corridor homes, and all Eastern Idaho regional areas.

  aboutService: >-
    Our licensed mattress removal team provides curbside pickup throughout Idaho Falls' diverse neighborhoods, from 
    historic Numbered Streets and downtown areas to scenic Temple View communities along the Snake River Greenbelt. 
    We handle every type of mattress - memory foam, innerspring, hybrid, latex - along with box springs and bed frames.
    
    Idaho Falls' role as the nuclear research capital of America creates specific removal challenges, from INL 
    professional housing transitions to scenic greenbelt properties requiring waterfront access coordination. 
    We manage the entire removal process with same-day scheduling and next-day pickup, working within Bonneville County 
    Transfer Station systems and Eagle Rock Sanitation coordination so residents don't navigate Eastern Idaho disposal complexities.

  serviceAreasIntro: >-
    We provide curbside mattress removal throughout Idaho Falls' 14+ neighborhoods, from downtown historic districts 
    to Snake River Landing developments along the 5-mile Greenbelt corridor. Our service covers INL workforce 
    housing requiring security clearance coordination, Temple View scenic properties, and regional healthcare 
    district areas across all ZIP codes 83401-83406.

  regulationsCompliance: >-
    Our service coordinates directly with Bonneville County Transfer Station and Idaho Falls Sanitation Division 
    for proper bulk disposal management. We handle all regulatory requirements for licensed hauling while 
    working with Idaho Department of Environmental Quality standards and nuclear research community protocols. 
    Since Idaho lacks state mattress stewardship programs, we prioritize recycling through certified facilities, 
    successfully recycling over 75% of collected mattresses while maintaining INL security compliance.

  environmentalImpact: >-
    Idaho Falls' nuclear research heritage and Snake River watershed protection demand responsible disposal practices 
    that safeguard both high-desert ecosystems and scientific community environmental standards. We partner with local 
    recycling facilities and donation networks to divert materials from Bonneville County systems, successfully recycling 
    over 75% of collected mattresses through certified Idaho partners.
    
    Our environmental approach serves Idaho Falls families by handling eco-conscious disposal for nuclear research 
    professional relocations, Snake River Greenbelt home upgrades, and regional healthcare district transitions. 
    Metal springs go to scrap recycling, foam becomes carpet padding, and fabric becomes industrial materials, 
    with only non-recyclable items going to licensed county disposal facilities.

  howItWorksScheduling: >-
    Schedule curbside pickup online in under 60 seconds or call (720) 263-6094 for same-day booking. Next-day

  howItWorksService: >-
    Our professional crew arrives for curbside pickup at your scheduled time. We handle the heavy lifting to get 
    mattresses from your home to the curb for removal. Our team navigates Idaho Falls' mix of nuclear research 
    community protocols, Snake River scenic property access, and regional healthcare district logistics efficiently.

  howItWorksDisposal: >-
    After pickup, we transport your mattress to appropriate recycling facilities or donation centers. Over 75% 
    of mattresses are recycled or donated, with only non-recyclable materials going to licensed disposal facilities. 
    You get peace of mind knowing your old mattress was handled responsibly and in compliance with all county and nuclear research community regulations.
