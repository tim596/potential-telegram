localRegulations: "Taylor residents cannot dispose of mattresses through Priority Waste's regular or bulk pickup services. Apartment complexes strictly prohibit mattress disposal in dumpsters, with fines up to $500. Wayne County's quarterly HHW collections exclude mattresses entirely. Our licensed service provides the only year-round compliant disposal option for Taylor's 62,000+ residents."

faqs:
  - question: "Why don't Taylor's waste services accept mattresses?"
    answer: "Priority Waste, Taylor's contracted hauler, excludes mattresses from both regular pickup and bulk collection due to disposal facility restrictions. Apartment complexes face $500 fines for mattresses in dumpsters. Our service bridges this gap with guaranteed proper disposal."
  - question: "How much does mattress pickup cost in Taylor?"
    answer: "Single mattress starts at $125, mattress plus box spring costs $155, and three-piece removal is $180. Pricing includes all labor, transportation, and certified recycling - no landfill dumping or additional fees."
  - question: "Do you handle Heritage Towers and other high-rise buildings?"
    answer: "Yes, we specialize in Taylor's senior housing complexes including Heritage Towers, Maplewood Manor, and apartment buildings along Goddard Road. Our team has protocols for narrow elevators, carpeted hallways, and building management requirements."
  - question: "Can you work around Ford plant shifts?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Taylor's automotive workforce works varying shifts at Ford Dearborn Assembly, Visteon, and SMW Manufacturing. We offer 7 AM to 7 PM scheduling plus weekends to accommodate all work schedules in our community."
  - question: "What happens to my mattress after pickup?"
    answer: "Every mattress goes to certified recycling facilities where 85% gets recovered: steel springs become automotive scrap metal (supporting local industry), foam becomes carpet padding, fabric becomes insulation. Nothing enters Wayne County landfills."
  - question: "Do you cover all Taylor neighborhoods?"
    answer: "Complete service throughout Taylor's 23.6 square miles, from Heritage Park to the Downriver industrial zone. We serve every address in ZIP code 48180, including Telegraph Road businesses, Ecorse Creek homes, and Southland Center area apartments."
  - question: "How quickly can I schedule pickup?"
    answer: "Next-day service available with calls before 3 PM. Online booking works 24/7 for advance scheduling. Unlike municipal bulk pickup, we have no seasonal blackouts or lengthy wait periods."
  - question: "What if I'm physically unable to move the mattress?"
    answer: "Our team handles all heavy lifting and navigation challenges. Particularly important for Taylor's aging population (16% over 65) in multi-story buildings. We bring equipment for stairs, tight corners, and narrow doorways."

  heroDescription: "Priority Waste won't take your mattress? Apartment fining you $500? We solve Taylor's mattress problem. Professional pickup from Heritage Park high-rises to Downriver homes - $125, next-day service, book in 60 seconds."
  
  aboutService: "Taylor's working-class community deserves convenient mattress disposal without the runaround. As Downriver's most populated city, Taylor faces disposal challenges that larger metros don't: apartment complexes with strict dumpster policies, Priority Waste's mattress exclusion, and aging housing stock with narrow staircases. Our service eliminates these barriers while supporting Taylor's environmental responsibility through complete mattress recycling - keeping materials out of Wayne County landfills and returning steel to the automotive supply chain."
  
  serviceAreasIntro: "Complete coverage across Taylor's distinct neighborhoods, from the senior towers around Heritage Park to single-family homes near Taylor Meadows Golf Course. We navigate the tight streets of Ecorse Village, handle multi-story buildings along Telegraph Road, and serve the newer developments near Southland Center. Our local expertise includes understanding building access protocols, parking restrictions during Ford shift changes, and the unique layouts of Taylor's post-WWII housing boom neighborhoods."
  
  regulationsCompliance: "Taylor's mattress disposal landscape is particularly restrictive compared to other Downriver communities. Priority Waste explicitly excludes mattresses from both regular and bulk pickup services, forcing residents to find alternatives. Apartment managers at complexes like Heritage Towers and properties along Goddard Road face municipal fines up to $500 for mattresses in dumpsters. Wayne County's quarterly HHW events help with hazardous materials but exclude mattresses entirely. Our year-round licensed service fills this crucial gap with immediate scheduling and guaranteed compliant disposal."
  
  environmentalImpact: "Without Michigan's mattress stewardship program, professional recycling becomes critical for Taylor's environmental footprint. Our partnerships with certified facilities ensure 85% material recovery: steel springs get processed for automotive manufacturing (directly supporting Taylor's industrial heritage), foam transforms into carpet padding for construction projects, and fabric fibers become insulation materials. Each Taylor pickup includes recycling documentation, proving environmental compliance while supporting the circular economy that built our community around automotive manufacturing."

  howItWorksScheduling: "Select morning (7-11 AM), afternoon (12-4 PM), or evening slots (5-7 PM) that work around Ford plant shifts. Weekend pickup available for automotive workers on weekday schedules. Same-day emergency removal for apartment move-outs."
  
  howItWorksService: "Our licensed team arrives with protective equipment for Heritage Park's narrow elevators and post-war Downriver staircases. We handle all lifting, wrapping, and transport while respecting senior building protocols and apartment complex access rules."
  
  howItWorksDisposal: "Every Taylor mattress gets transported to certified Michigan recycling facilities where steel springs return to automotive manufacturing, foam becomes carpet padding, and fabrics become insulation. You receive documentation proving zero-landfill compliance."
