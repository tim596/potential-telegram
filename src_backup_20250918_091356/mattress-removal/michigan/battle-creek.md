      text: "So I've been putting off getting rid of this old box spring for like 6 months, you know how it is. Finally bit the bullet and called these folks. They were awesome! Showed up when they said they would, which honestly surprised me a bit. The guy explained their whole recycling thing while they worked - apparently the metal coils get turned into new steel products and the fabric becomes stuff for cars. Pretty cool if you ask me. They even cleaned up some foam bits that fell off. $125 well spent."

      text: "Excellent service for our king mattress removal! The team was incredibly professional and efficient. They navigated our military housing complex's narrow stairwells without any issues whatsoever. Everything was wrapped properly according to base requirements, and they coordinated perfectly with our housing office schedule. The $155 price was exactly as quoted with zero hidden fees. They even provided documentation for our housing records. Highly recommend their service to anyone in the Fort Custer area or greater Battle Creek community."

  heroDescription: "Battle Creek's dedicated mattress removal team. Where Kellogg's feeds America breakfast, we recycle America's bedroom furniture - extracting maximum value from every disposal across this 51,000-resident city."

  aboutService: |
    <p>Mattress removal gets industrialized in Battle Creek - birthplace of breakfast cereal and precision manufacturing. Our extraction specialists handle everything from executive king-size sets in Kellogg corporate housing to military-issued twins at Fort Custer, applying the same systematic approach that made this city America's breakfast capital. Each pickup recovers 85% of materials through targeted recycling streams designed specifically for southwest Michigan's manufacturing ecosystem.</p>
    
    <p>Springs become steel again. Those coil assemblies from your old Beautyrest travel to Kalamazoo's metal processors, where they're reforged into agricultural equipment serving Michigan's expansive farmland. Memory foam gets a second career as packaging insulation for Post cereals shipping worldwide from Battle Creek's distribution hubs. Fabric components transform into industrial filters for food processing - maintaining Battle Creek's commitment to clean manufacturing standards.</p>
    
    <p>Timing matters when Kellogg's three shifts move 15,000 workers daily through Battle Creek's streets. We coordinate removals around 6 AM, 2 PM, and 10 PM shift changes, avoiding Columbia Avenue congestion while maintaining Fort Custer's strict base access protocols. Our crews understand both military housing documentation requirements and corporate property management standards - essential knowledge in a city where uniformed personnel and cereal executives often live in the same neighborhoods.</p>

  serviceAreasIntro: "Battle Creek's neighborhoods tell America's breakfast story. From Lakeview's 1920s executive homes where cereal fortunes were built to Fort Custer's modern military housing, each area demands specialized removal expertise."

  regulationsCompliance: "Our Battle Creek team ensures complete compliance with city disposal requirements, including mandatory plastic wrapping and coordination with Republic Services. We handle all documentation needs for corporate housing, military housing, and standard residential properties."

  environmentalImpact: |
    <p>Food-grade manufacturing demands exceptional material standards - and Battle Creek's mattress recycling reflects this precision. Steel coils become agricultural machinery serving Michigan's vast cereal grain farms. Foam insulation protects temperature-sensitive shipments from Kellogg's frozen food divisions. Fabric components filter air in Post's sugar processing facilities, maintaining the contamination-free environments essential for breakfast cereal production.</p>
    
    <p>This circular approach diverts 85% of bedroom waste from Calhoun County landfills while feeding raw materials back into the agricultural-industrial complex that defines southwest Michigan. Your old mattress contributes directly to the supply chains that stock America's breakfast tables - completing a cycle that began when W.K. Kellogg first mechanized cereal production in downtown Battle Creek.</p>
