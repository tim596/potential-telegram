localRegulations: "Iowa City requires advance scheduling through city services during business hours, with mandatory preparation and curbside placement restrictions that conflict with academic calendar demands. Johnson County facilities charge disposal fees while sending mattresses to landfills, completely ignoring the environmental values central to university community culture. Student housing complexes often prohibit curbside placement, creating logistical nightmares during peak move-out periods. Why navigate bureaucratic scheduling, academic calendar conflicts, and property management restrictions when you need immediate removal? Our next-day service eliminates scheduling hassles, works around semester transitions, and guarantees 100% recycling that aligns with Iowa City's intellectual and environmental consciousness."

faqs:
  - question: "How does pickup work during Iowa City's academic calendar transitions?"
    answer: "We understand university town rhythms - semester moves, summer session transitions, graduation periods. Next-day scheduling works around Iowa Writers' Workshop residencies, medical student rotations, and the intense May/August housing turnover without city scheduling conflicts."
  - question: "Do you serve all Iowa City neighborhoods and surrounding areas?"
    answer: "Absolutely. From downtown Pedestrian Mall to University Heights, medical campus housing to graduate districts - we serve the entire Iowa City area throughout Johnson County."
  - question: "Can you handle University of Iowa student housing requirements?"
    answer: "Yes. Our team understands varied student housing - high-rise dorms, off-campus apartments, co-op housing, faculty residences. We navigate different building access and property management requirements professionally."
  - question: "What's included beyond basic removal?"
    answer: "Complete service includes pickup from any floor, professional transportation, and 100% mattress recycling. No advance city scheduling, property management coordination, or semester timing restrictions."
  - question: "How does recycling work compared to Johnson County disposal?"
    answer: "Johnson County facilities charge fees for landfill disposal. We guarantee 100% recycling - steel springs become research equipment, foam becomes laboratory padding, fabric converts to insulation products supporting Iowa's innovation economy."
  - question: "Do you accommodate Writers' Workshop and research community schedules?"
    answer: "Definitely. Academic residencies, research deadlines, conference travel, sabbatical relocations - we handle the unique scheduling needs of Iowa City's literary and academic community."
  - question: "Can you work around Iowa City's unique housing mix?"
    answer: "Our service understands everything from historic downtown apartments to modern faculty housing, student cooperatives to medical campus residences. We handle Iowa City's diverse architectural and access challenges."
  - question: "How does your service compare to city bulk pickup during semester transitions?"
    answer: "Immediate next-day availability versus advance business-hour scheduling, professional indoor removal versus curbside restrictions, and guaranteed recycling rather than landfill disposal during peak academic calendar periods."
