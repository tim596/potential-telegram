faqs:
  - question: "How does your service work with St. Paul's free mattress recycling program?"
    answer: "We coordinate with Second Chance Recycling and the city's program when beneficial for residents. Our service adds convenience with flexible scheduling and removal from any location, while the city program requires curbside placement and advance scheduling."
    
  - question: "Do you service all 17 St. Paul planning districts?"
    answer: "Yes, we provide mattress removal throughout all planning districts from Downtown and Summit Hill to Highland Park, West Side, and Greater East Side. We're familiar with the unique housing types and logistics in each district."
    
  - question: "Can you handle mattress removal from historic St. Paul homes?"
    answer: "Absolutely. St. Paul's historic neighborhoods like Summit Hill and Macalester-Groveland often have narrow staircases, original hardwood floors, and unique architectural features. Our team specializes in protecting these historic elements during removal."
    
  - question: "What's included in your St. Paul mattress removal service?"
    answer: "Complete removal from any location (downtown high-rises, historic homes, multi-family housing), loading, transport to certified recycling facilities, and cleanup. We handle Ramsey County disposal requirements and coordinate with building management when needed."
    
  - question: "Do you work with St. Paul property management companies?"
    answer: "Yes, we regularly service multi-family properties throughout St. Paul's diverse housing stock. We provide required disposal documentation and coordinate timing to meet lease requirements and security deposit terms."
    
  - question: "Can you remove mattresses from downtown St. Paul high-rises?"
    answer: "Our team specializes in urban logistics including high-rise buildings, service elevators, loading dock coordination, and building management requirements common in downtown St. Paul's residential towers."
    
  - question: "How do I schedule pickup in the Twin Cities metro?"
    answer: "Book online or call 720-263-6094. Next-day service available throughout St. Paul with same-day often possible. We maintain expanded capacity specifically for the Twin Cities metropolitan area."
    
  - question: "Are you licensed for mattress disposal in Ramsey County?"
    answer: "Yes, we maintain all required Minnesota and Ramsey County licenses for waste hauling and mattress disposal. We work with approved recycling facilities and provide documentation that satisfies city and county requirements."

localRegulations: "Ramsey County classifies mattresses as problematic bulky waste due to their difficulty in handling, equipment-clogging properties, and inability to compact in landfills. The City of St. Paul operates a comprehensive free mattress recycling program through Second Chance Recycling, having recycled over 9,200 mattresses in 2024, but this requires curbside placement by 6 a.m. on scheduled collection days, attachment of recycling program signage, and advance scheduling that may not accommodate urgent needs. While we also offer convenient curbside removal, our professional service provides superior flexibility with same-day and next-day availability, indoor pickup from any location within your property, and no weather-related delays that can affect municipal programs. We maintain all required Ramsey County waste hauler licenses and work directly with certified recycling facilities, providing disposal documentation that satisfies both residential lease requirements and commercial property management standards. Unlike the city's program which operates on fixed routes with limited scheduling windows, our service accommodates urgent timelines, building management coordination, and the unique logistics challenges across St. Paul's diverse housing types from historic Summit Hill mansions with narrow staircases to modern downtown high-rises with service elevator requirements."
