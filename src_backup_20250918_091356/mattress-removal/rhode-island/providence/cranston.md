localRegulations: "Cranston requires mattresses to be scheduled as bulk items through Waste Management's collection system, coordinating with 64-gallon cart placement curbside by 6 a.m. on designated collection days. The WM service includes holiday delays that affect collection schedules throughout the week, and all bulk items must meet specific size and preparation requirements. As Rhode Island's second-largest city with 82,934 residents, Cranston's mattress disposal involves coordination between residents and WM's scheduling system across diverse neighborhoods from Garden City to Pawtuxet Village."

From families throughout Garden City's suburban streets to residents in diverse neighborhoods like Knightsville and homeowners in Edgewood's historic areas, Cranston faces distinct mattress disposal challenges across this metropolitan area.

Whether you live near Pawtuxet Village's waterfront, in Auburn's residential areas, or throughout Oaklawn's family neighborhoods, we understand the practical disposal needs of Rhode Island's second-largest city. Each collected mattress flows through our national recycling network that has processed over 1 million units, with 80% of materials recovered for manufacturing reuse - supporting efficient waste management that serves Cranston's growing suburban community."
