      text: "Booked online Sunday, mattress gone Tuesday. The team worked efficiently around our kids' toys in the front yard and even helped move our old box spring from upstairs. Much better than trying to figure out the GarbCard system at the recycling center - this was so much easier and honestly not much more expensive when you factor in gas and time."
