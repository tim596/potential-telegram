  heroDescription: >-
    Professional mattress removal throughout Roswell's historic neighborhoods and family communities. 
    Next-day pickup with licensed team handling curbside removal and eco-friendly disposal. 
    Serving Historic District, Mill Village, and all residential developments.
  
  aboutService: >-
    Our licensed mattress removal team provides curbside pickup throughout Roswell's diverse neighborhoods, from 
    Historic District mill homes to modern family developments in Martins Landing and Heritage Creek. We handle 
    every type of mattress - memory foam, innerspring, hybrid, latex - along with box springs and bed frames.
    
    Roswell's mix of antebellum properties and contemporary neighborhoods requires coordinated logistics around 
    narrow Historic District streets and family schedules. We manage the entire removal process with same-day 
    scheduling and next-day pickup, handling transportation, disposal regulations, and recycling so residents 
    don't have to navigate Fulton County requirements or find certified facilities.

  serviceAreasIntro: >-
    We provide curbside mattress removal throughout Roswell's 18+ neighborhoods, from the 640-acre Historic District 
    to contemporary family developments. Our service covers established areas like Mill Village with narrow streets 
    requiring coordination, suburban neighborhoods like Martins Landing and Heritage Creek, and rural communities 
    like Crabapple and Sweet Apple across all ZIP codes 30075-30077.

  regulationsCompliance: >-
    Our service handles Fulton County compliance through direct coordination with Waste Pro, Roswell's contracted 
    waste management provider. We manage all regulatory requirements for licensed hauling while bypassing the City 
    of Roswell's mandatory solid waste program restrictions. Since Georgia lacks state mattress stewardship programs, 
    we prioritize recycling through certified private facilities, successfully recycling over 75% of collected mattresses.
  
  environmentalImpact: >-
    Roswell's family-oriented community values responsible disposal practices that complement the city's preservation 
    character. We partner with private recycling facilities and donation networks to divert materials from landfills, 
    successfully recycling over 75% of collected mattresses through certified facilities.
    
    Our environmental approach supports Roswell residents by handling eco-conscious disposal for family transitions, 
    home renovations around historic properties, and estate management in established neighborhoods. Metal springs 
    go to scrap recycling, foam becomes carpet padding, and fabric becomes industrial materials, with only 
    non-recyclable items going to licensed Fulton County disposal facilities.

  howItWorksScheduling: >-
    Schedule curbside pickup online in under 60 seconds or call (720) 263-6094 for same-day booking. Next-day

  howItWorksService: >-
    Our professional crew arrives for curbside pickup at your scheduled time. We handle the heavy lifting to get 
    mattresses from your home to the curb for removal. Our team navigates Roswell's mix of narrow Historic District 
    streets and modern neighborhood layouts, coordinating with preservation requirements and family schedules.

  howItWorksDisposal: >-
    After pickup, we transport your mattress to appropriate recycling facilities or donation centers. Over 75% 
    of mattresses are recycled or donated, with only non-recyclable materials going to licensed disposal facilities. 
    You get peace of mind knowing your old mattress was handled responsibly and in compliance with all regulations.
