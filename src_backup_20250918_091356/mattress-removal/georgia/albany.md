  heroDescription: >-
    Professional mattress removal service throughout Albany's neighborhoods and rural areas. 
    Next-day curbside pickup with licensed team handling disposal and recycling. 
    Serving Historic District, Doublegate, Radium Springs, and all residential areas.

  aboutService: >-
    Our licensed mattress removal team provides curbside pickup throughout Albany's diverse neighborhoods, from 
    historic downtown areas to upscale Doublegate developments and rural Radium Springs communities. We handle 
    every type of mattress - memory foam, innerspring, hybrid, latex - along with box springs and bed frames.
    
    Albany's role as southwest Georgia's regional hub creates unique disposal challenges, from historic district 
    coordination to rural property access. We manage the entire removal process with same-day scheduling and 
    next-day pickup, handling city and county waste management requirements so residents don't have to navigate 
    Albany Public Works or Dougherty County Solid Waste Management regulations.

  serviceAreasIntro: >-
    We provide curbside mattress removal throughout Albany's 18+ neighborhoods, from the Historic District 
    to Radium Springs natural area. Our service covers established neighborhoods like Doublegate and Sherwood Forest 
    requiring coordination, downtown areas with older infrastructure, and rural communities across all ZIP codes 
    31701-31721.

  regulationsCompliance: >-
    Our service handles both Albany Public Works and Dougherty County Solid Waste Management requirements for proper 
    mattress disposal. We coordinate bulk item pickup regulations that require advance scheduling, managing all 
    compliance paperwork while working with both city and county systems. We recycle over 75% of collected mattresses 
    through certified Georgia facilities since the state lacks mattress stewardship programs.

  environmentalImpact: >-
    Albany's position as a regional agricultural center emphasizes responsible disposal practices that support 
    both environmental quality and rural community values. We partner with private recycling facilities and 
    donation networks to divert materials from landfills, successfully recycling over 75% of collected mattresses.
    
    Our environmental approach supports Albany families by handling eco-conscious disposal for moves between 
    rural properties, urban redevelopment projects, and estate transitions in historic neighborhoods. Metal springs 
    go to scrap recycling, foam becomes carpet padding, and fabric becomes industrial materials, with only 
    non-recyclable items going to Dougherty County landfill facilities.

  howItWorksScheduling: >-
    Schedule curbside pickup online in under 60 seconds or call (720) 263-6094 for same-day booking. Next-day 
    pickup available throughout all Albany neighborhoods with scheduling coordinated around agricultural schedules, 
    historic district access considerations, and rural property logistics.

  howItWorksService: >-
    Our professional crew arrives for curbside pickup at your scheduled time. We handle the heavy lifting to get 
    mattresses from your home to the curb for removal. Our team navigates Albany's mix of historic downtown streets, 
    suburban developments like Doublegate, and rural access roads around Radium Springs area.

  howItWorksDisposal: >-
    After pickup, we transport your mattress to appropriate recycling facilities or donation centers. Over 75% 
    of mattresses are recycled or donated, with only non-recyclable materials going to licensed disposal facilities. 
    You get peace of mind knowing your old mattress was handled responsibly and in compliance with all city and county regulations.
