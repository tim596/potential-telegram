faqs:
  - question: "How does pickup work in Covington's historic neighborhoods?"
    answer: "We understand Northern Kentucky's historic districts - narrow streets in Riverside, MainStrasse Village access, and older building challenges. Our team navigates these areas professionally with proper equipment and care."
  - question: "Do you serve all Covington neighborhoods and surrounding areas?"
    answer: "Absolutely. From Historic District along the Ohio River to Westside residential areas, MainStrasse Village to Latonia neighborhoods - we serve the entire Covington area throughout Kenton County."
  - question: "Can you handle Ohio River area logistics?"
    answer: "Yes. Our team understands riverfront access challenges, historic district parking restrictions, and the unique geography of Northern Kentucky's Ohio River communities."
  - question: "What's included beyond basic removal?"
    answer: "Complete service includes pickup from any floor, professional transportation, and 100% mattress recycling. No city coordination, county facility trips, or historic district access worries."
  - question: "How does recycling work compared to Kenton County disposal?"
    answer: "County facilities typically landfill mattresses despite disposal fees. We guarantee 100% recycling - steel springs become manufacturing materials, foam becomes padding, fabric converts to sustainable products."

    answer: "Definitely. Healthcare workers, government employees, service professionals - we handle the scheduling needs of Covington's diverse workforce with flexible next-day availability."
  - question: "Can you work around Covington's urban density challenges?"
    answer: "Our service handles everything from historic district apartments to modern residential developments, narrow street access to riverfront properties throughout Northern Kentucky's premier river city."
  - question: "How does your service compare to city bulk pickup scheduling?"
    answer: "Immediate next-day availability versus advance scheduling requirements, professional indoor removal versus curbside restrictions, and guaranteed recycling rather than standard disposal methods."
