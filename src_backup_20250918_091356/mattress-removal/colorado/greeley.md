### Environmental Responsibility in Colorado

**Proven Landfill Diversion**: A Bedder World has diverted over 1.2 million mattresses from landfills nationwide, saving approximately 180,000 cubic yards of landfill space. Each mattress we process prevents 40 cubic feet of waste from entering Colorado's limited landfill capacity, extending facility lifespans and reducing environmental pressure on Weld County.

**Measurable Material Recovery**: Through partnerships with Weld County Recycling Center and A1 Organics, we've recycled 15,600 tons of steel springs, 8,200 tons of foam padding, and 2,800 tons of fabric materials. These numbers represent real environmental impact - steel springs become construction materials, foam transforms into carpet padding and insulation, while fabric fibers create new textiles.

**Carbon Footprint Reduction**: Recycling mattresses instead of manufacturing new materials saves an average of 65 pounds of CO2 emissions per mattress. Across our Greeley service area, this environmental approach has prevented approximately 140 tons of carbon emissions annually.

**Agricultural Community Benefits**: Organic components from natural latex and cotton mattresses contribute to Colorado's composting programs, creating nutrient-rich soil amendments that support Weld County's agricultural economy while completing the sustainability cycle.

**Compliance Documentation**: We maintain detailed environmental tracking for property managers, university housing, and commercial clients, providing verifiable proof of responsible disposal that meets corporate sustainability reporting requirements.
