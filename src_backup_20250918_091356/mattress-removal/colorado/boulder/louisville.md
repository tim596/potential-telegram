  heroSubtitle: " • Local Louisville Company • Historic Mining Town to Modern Communities"
  heroDescription: "Based right here in Louisville, A Bedder World provides professional mattress removal throughout our community. From historic Old Town mining cottages to modern developments like Coal Creek Ranch and Heritage Park, we handle pickup, loading, and transport to our in-house recycling facility. Book online for next-day service."
  
  aboutService: "As a Louisville-based company, we understand our community's unique blend of historic mining heritage and modern suburban affluence, creating diverse mattress removal needs across varied housing types and community situations. Old Town's historic mining cottages require careful navigation of narrow doorways, steep stairs, and period architectural features while protecting original hardwood floors and vintage details. Coal Creek Ranch's golf course community faces ongoing rebuilding challenges following the Marshall Fire, requiring sensitive coordination with construction schedules and respect for the recovery process. Modern neighborhoods like Heritage Park and Steel Ranch feature family-oriented communities with quality-of-life focus, demanding reliable service that fits busy suburban schedules. As your local neighbors, we share Louisville residents' values and provide comprehensive recycling that aligns with Boulder County's environmental leadership and our community's strong environmental consciousness."
  
  serviceAreasIntro: "Professional mattress pickup throughout Louisville's diverse communities, from historic Old Town mining cottages to rebuilt Coal Creek Ranch golf course homes and established neighborhoods like Heritage Park and Centennial Heights. We understand each area's unique character and coordinate with community events, construction schedules, and family routines."
  
  environmentalImpact: "Louisville's environmental consciousness as part of Boulder County demands responsible disposal practices, and our in-house recycling facility delivers exactly that. Every Louisville mattress gets completely dismantled at our Denver facility where metal springs become new steel products, foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabric gets processed into insulation materials. This comprehensive approach exceeds local disposal options through Republic Services and eliminates fees associated with traditional landfill disposal. Our service supports Louisville's quality-of-life values while providing convenient year-round pickup that complements the city's single-stream recycling program with unlimited capacity and proper environmental processing that meets Boulder County Resource Conservation Division standards."
  
  pricingContext: "Louisville's affluent housing market - from historic Old Town properties to luxury Coal Creek Ranch golf course homes and family neighborhoods like Heritage Park - means varied pickup scenarios, but our pricing remains transparent and fair. Whether removing mattresses from post-Marshall Fire rebuilding projects or routine family upgrades, base rates stay consistent. We factor in Louisville's environmental values by including proper recycling in every price, never charging extra fees like traditional disposal services."
  
  howItWorksScheduling: "Next-day pickup available throughout Louisville with flexible scheduling around community events, Marshall Fire rebuilding projects, and family activities. We coordinate timing to avoid Front Street events, construction schedules, and work with recreation center and school activities."
  
  howItWorksService: "Our Louisville-based team lives and works in the community, understanding its unique character from the inside - navigating Old Town's historic mining cottages, coordinating with Coal Creek Ranch rebuilding projects, and respecting family neighborhood guidelines throughout areas like Heritage Park and Steel Ranch. Being local means we're invested in our community's success."
