Every Fort Collins mattress gets completely dismantled at our Denver facility where metal springs become new steel products, foam transforms into carpet padding, and fabric gets processed into insulation materials. This comprehensive approach exceeds local disposal options and eliminates the fees charged at Larimer County Landfill. Unlike the Pay-As-You-Throw system that charges by volume, our service includes environmental responsibility in every pickup while maintaining Fort Collins' sustainability leadership in the Front Range region."
