      text: "Moving out of our rental and needed three mattresses gone fast. Booked online Sunday night, they picked up Tuesday morning. Guys were friendly, cleaned up after themselves. Love that they actually recycle everything instead of just dumping it."

      text: "Renovation project meant getting rid of guest room mattress and old box spring. These folks made it easy - showed up exactly when promised, loaded everything quick. Fair price at $155, and knowing it gets recycled properly is worth it."
faqs:
  - question: "How quickly can you pick up my mattress in Thornton?"
    answer: "We offer next-day service in Thornton. Book online or call (720) 263-6094 before 2 PM and we'll typically pick up the following day. We serve all Thornton neighborhoods from Signal Creek to Eastlake."

This keeps mattresses out of Colorado landfills and supports the local recycling economy. Unlike Thornton's city drop-off events with 4-piece limits, our facility processes unlimited quantities year-round. Each mattress saves 23 cubic feet of landfill space - significant for a growing city generating more waste. We strip metal springs for scrap recycling, convert foam into carpet padding, and process fabric components, ensuring nothing goes to waste while meeting Adams County disposal regulations."
