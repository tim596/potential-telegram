  heroDescription: "Fast, eco-friendly mattress pickup in Lincoln  Same-day scheduling available for UNL students, government workers, and residents throughout Nebraska's capital city."
  aboutService: "Need mattress removal in Lincoln? We provide guaranteed recycling through our nationwide network that has processed over 1 million mattresses sustainably. Our service covers Nebraska's capital from the historic Haymarket District to growing areas like Far South Lincoln and Yankee Ridge. With 23,992 University of Nebraska students creating massive annual housing turnover and thousands of state government workers requiring reliable services, Lincoln demands flexible disposal that coordinates with both academic calendars and professional relocations. Whether you're managing student move-outs in University Place, government housing transitions downtown, or family upgrades in neighborhoods like Woods Park and Country Club, we ensure your mattresses support Lincoln's Climate Action Plan through proper recycling rather than landfill disposal. Our dual-market service understands both Lincoln's governmental stability and university dynamism."
  serviceAreasIntro: "From the State Capitol to UNL's East Campus, our eco-friendly pickup reaches every household throughout Nebraska's governmental heart and academic soul:"
  regulationsCompliance: "Lincoln residents benefit from Husker Refuse Services' comprehensive waste management including monthly bulk pickup services and Waste Connections' sustainability-focused collection programs. However, Nebraska lacks the mattress stewardship programs operating in California, Oregon, and Connecticut. While the city provides excellent municipal services, specialized mattress recycling requires certified private services that align with Lincoln's Climate Action Plan and UNL's sustainability master plan. Our documented sustainable disposal supports the city's waste reduction goals and provides accountability documentation that university facilities, state government offices, and environmentally conscious residents require. With 300,000+ residents in Nebraska's capital and university center, our eco-friendly approach offers the specialized recycling service that supports both governmental environmental leadership and academic sustainability research."
  environmentalImpact: "Our Lincoln service connects to a nationwide recycling network that has diverted over 1 million mattresses from landfills. Each mattress generates approximately 75 pounds of steel for construction projects, 15 pounds of foam for carpet padding production, and fabric for insulation manufacturing. This circular economy approach supports Lincoln's Climate Action Plan goals while providing documentation that UNL's Office of Sustainability, state environmental agencies, and the Chancellor's Environment, Sustainability and Resilience Commission require for reporting. We partner with Nebraska regional processing facilities and Lancaster County environmental services, creating local economic value from Lincoln's waste stream while supporting the capital city's commitment to climate leadership and the university's 10 aspirational sustainability goals."
  howItWorksScheduling: "Same-day eco-friendly appointments throughout Lincoln area.

  howItWorksService: "Professional environmental team provides curbside collection using eco-equipped vehicles.

  howItWorksDisposal: "Your mattress enters our documented recycling network where 90%+ of materials become new products. Steel components go to certified processing facilities, while foam supports manufacturing - complete environmental accountability supporting Lincoln's climate leadership and UNL's sustainability research mission."
