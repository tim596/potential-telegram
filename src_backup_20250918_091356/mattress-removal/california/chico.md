Each mattress we process diverts approximately 40 pounds of materials from Butte County landfills through Neal Road's successful recycling program and other certified facilities. Steel springs go to scrap metal markets, textiles become industrial materials, and wood components provide biomass fuel. This directly supports county waste diversion goals while reinforcing the environmental consciousness that CSU Chico students and residents value in their community."
