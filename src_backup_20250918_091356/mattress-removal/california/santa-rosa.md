  serviceAreasIntro: "We serve all Santa Rosa neighborhoods with specialized equipment for Wine Country and post-fire rebuilding challenges:"
  
  environmentalImpact: "Sonoma County's wine country environment requires careful mattress disposal to protect both agricultural and natural ecosystems. Each mattress we recycle diverts approximately 40 pounds of material from landfills and is processed through Zero Waste Sonoma's regional programs and Recology Sonoma Marin's facility at 3400 Standish Avenue. This prevents contamination of wine country soils and watershed systems essential to Sonoma County viticulture while supporting the county's waste diversion goals. Materials are handled following post-fire environmental recovery standards that protect both rebuilt communities and surrounding natural areas."
  
  regulationsCompliance: "Our service maintains all required permits with the Sonoma County Waste Management Agency at 2300 County Center Drive and coordinates with Recology Sonoma Marin's 2025 rate structure and service protocols. All mattress disposal follows California's 2025 mattress stewardship program requirements while complying with post-fire building codes and environmental recovery standards. We coordinate with Zero Waste Sonoma's regional waste reduction initiatives and Republic Services' transfer station operations. Our operations align with wine country agricultural protection requirements and post-fire neighborhood reconstruction guidelines established by Santa Rosa's rebuilding ordinances."
  
  howItWorksScheduling: "We schedule around Santa Rosa's wine country tourism seasons, avoiding peak traffic during harvest periods and weekend wine tours. Post-fire reconstruction schedules and construction activity are considered when planning neighborhood appointments."
  
  howItWorksService: "Our team brings specialized equipment for both historic preservation requirements and modern post-fire construction standards. We understand wine country property access challenges and coordinate with ongoing reconstruction projects throughout Santa Rosa."

localRegulations: "Sonoma County operates under the Sonoma County Waste Management Agency oversight with Recology Sonoma Marin as the exclusive waste hauler implementing 2025 rate increases and service protocols. Zero Waste Sonoma coordinates regional waste reduction programs across the county. Post-fire rebuilding ordinances in Santa Rosa establish specific standards for construction debris and waste handling in rebuilt neighborhoods. Wine country agricultural protection requirements affect waste disposal near vineyard properties and watershed areas. The Central Disposal Site on Mecham Road outside Petaluma serves as the primary regional recycling facility operated by Republic Services, with additional transfer stations in Healdsburg and other county locations supporting comprehensive waste diversion goals."
