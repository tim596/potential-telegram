localRegulations: "San Jose operates under Santa Clara County waste management regulations with additional municipal requirements reflecting its status as Silicon Valley's largest city. The city's massive scale requires coordinated scheduling across multiple districts connected by light rail, and corporate housing programs for major tech companies have specific bulk waste protocols. San Jose State University creates predictable seasonal demand during move-in and move-out periods. Our service provides multilingual support when needed to assist residents with understanding local waste disposal requirements. San Jose's environmental leadership initiatives require certified haulers to meet higher sustainability standards than many other cities. Our service coordinates with the city's diverse neighborhoods while ensuring compliance with both county regulations and San Jose's additional environmental requirements."
