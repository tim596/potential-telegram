localRegulations: "San Mateo operates under comprehensive San Mateo County waste management regulations administered by Recology San Mateo County. The city's unique mix of high-density developments and premium single-family neighborhoods requires specialized coordination - multi-family properties must schedule through property management, while hillside locations may need advance planning for vehicle access. San Mateo's height restrictions and development patterns create specific logistics challenges for bulk waste removal. The city's tech industry presence generates predictable corporate housing turnover requiring flexible scheduling. Our service navigates these local requirements while ensuring compliance with California's Mattress Stewardship Program and San Mateo County's environmental standards for certified waste haulers."
