  serviceAreasIntro: "We serve all Stockton neighborhoods with specialized equipment for Delta port city and university community challenges:"
  
  environmentalImpact: "San Joaquin County's Delta location requires careful mattress disposal to protect both agricultural and waterway ecosystems. Each mattress we recycle diverts approximately 40 pounds of material from landfills and is processed through San Joaquin County's solid waste facilities and Republic Services operations. This prevents contamination of Delta waterways and agricultural soils essential to the region while supporting the county's Recycling Market Development Zone covering Stockton and surrounding communities. Materials are handled following environmental standards that protect both the sensitive Delta ecosystem and agricultural operations throughout San Joaquin County."

All mattress disposal follows California's 2025 mattress stewardship program requirements while complying with Delta region environmental protections and agricultural area regulations. We coordinate with the San Joaquin County Household Hazardous Waste Facility at 7850 R.A. Bridgeford Street and support the county's sustainability initiatives. Our operations align with port city logistics requirements and university housing compliance standards established by both San Joaquin County and University of Pacific policies."
