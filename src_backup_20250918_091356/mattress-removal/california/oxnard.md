localRegulations: "Ventura County enforces some of California's strictest mattress disposal regulations due to coastal environmental protection requirements. All mattresses must be wrapped in 6-mil plastic sheeting with approved disposal tags before transport. The county prohibits mattress disposal at standard transfer stations - only certified recycling facilities can accept them. Violators face fines from $500-$1,000 per mattress. Additionally, Oxnard's coastal zones require special permits for bulk item pickup due to beach access restrictions and marine protection ordinances. Our service handles all county permits, environmental documentation, and certified facility coordination to ensure full legal compliance."
