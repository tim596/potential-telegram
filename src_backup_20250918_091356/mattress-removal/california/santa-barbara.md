  serviceAreasIntro: "We serve all Santa Barbara neighborhoods with specialized equipment for each area's unique challenges:"
  
  environmentalImpact: "Santa Barbara County's coastal location requires strict environmental protection under Coastal Commission oversight. Each mattress we recycle diverts approximately 40 pounds of material from landfills and is processed at the South Coast Recycling & Transfer Station at 4430 Calle Real or MarBorg facilities at 132 Nopalitos Way and 20 David Love Place in Goleta. These certified facilities maintain biological productivity standards for coastal waters and marine organisms, preventing contamination of Santa Barbara's sensitive marine ecosystem while supporting the county's 2025 goal of 75% organic waste reduction under SB 1383 regulations."
  
  regulationsCompliance: "Our service maintains all required Santa Barbara County Resource Recovery & Waste Management Division permits for waste transport and disposal operations. We coordinate directly with the division's four county-operated facilities (South Coast, Santa Ynez Valley, New Cuyama, and Ventucopa) and comply with the county's Solid Waste Program regulations administered by Environmental Health Services. All mattress disposal follows California Coastal Act requirements for marine resource protection, maintaining biological productivity of coastal waters while preventing contamination through controlled runoff and proper waste water management as mandated by the Coastal Commission's environmental standards."

localRegulations: "Santa Barbara County Resource Recovery & Waste Management Division, part of the Public Works Department, enforces comprehensive environmental standards under California Coastal Commission oversight. The division operates four distinct waste management facilities across the county and requires specific documentation for all waste transport vehicles. Mattress disposal must comply with SB 1383 organic waste reduction mandates (75% reduction by 2025) and California Coastal Act marine protection standards. The South Coast region follows different organic waste protocols than North County areas, with food scraps remaining in regular trash while yard waste uses green containers. Our service maintains current permits with Environmental Health Services' Solid Waste Program and coordinates with MarBorg's bulky item pickup services that provide residents four annual free pickups including mattresses."
