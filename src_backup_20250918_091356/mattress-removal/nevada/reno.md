  - question: Can you handle Reno's mountain community access?
    answer: Absolutely. Our team regularly works in foothills communities like Arrowcreek, Galena, and Somersett with mountain views and elevated terrain. We navigate steep driveways, understand high-altitude logistics, and provide reliable pickup service regardless of elevation or access challenges.

  - question: How does your service work with Waste Management bulk pickup?
    answer: We provide independent pickup service that doesn't require coordination with WM bulk scheduling. While Waste Management requires advance scheduling for transfer station trips, we offer convenient next-day service with all logistics handled directly, eliminating the need to coordinate municipal pickup timing.
  - question: Do you provide service documentation for rental properties?
    answer: Yes, we provide detailed service receipts and environmental compliance documentation that landlords and property managers may require. Our licensed service meets Reno housing standards and provides proper disposal certification for your rental property records.
  - question: Can you handle high desert weather conditions?
    answer: Yes, our team is equipped for Reno's high desert climate including winter snow, wind conditions, and elevation challenges. We maintain flexible scheduling for weather delays and use appropriate equipment for reliable service delivery in the Sierra Nevada foothills environment.
  - question: How do you ensure proper recycling in Nevada's tech hub?
    answer: Reno's tech industry leadership creates high expectations for environmental responsibility. We provide certified recycling through Nevada-approved facilities where 80% of materials become new products, supporting Reno's innovation economy while providing documentation that tech companies and university facilities require for environmental compliance.
