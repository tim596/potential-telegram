If you are looking to get rid of a mattress in the Mesa AZ area you have come to the right place. In this article we will cover 5 options that residents can use to get rid of a Mattress in Mesa.

## Option #3: Drop at [The Local Landfill](https://www.mesaaz.gov/residents/trash-recycling/trash-recycling-for-single-family-homes/landfill-use-program)

![Salt River Landfill](/images/blog/638121436534000000)

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress before dumping it in the landfill. Mattresses do not break down efficiently and take up a lot of unneeded landfill space. But sometimes the landfill is the only option. If you decide to use the landfill for disposal of your mattress, Mesa residnets can take advantage of the Landfill use program once a month to drop waste. Read about the landfill use program in Mesa below:

### Landfill Use Program:

City of Mesa Solid Waste customers can use the Residential Landfill Use Program to receive a discounted rate at the landfill once per month.

#### Who can use the program?

- Current City of Mesa Solid Waste customers with rate codes R1.2, R1.26, or R1.29.

- Customers must present a copy of their current or previous month's Mesa utility bill and a valid driver's license. The name and/or address on the utility bill must match the driver's license. Online billing customers may show their utility bill on a mobile device but for faster service, a printed copy is recommended.

#### Program Guidelines:

- The Residential Landfill Program allows Mesa Solid Waste customers to dump up to 2,000 pounds of non-hazardous waste once per month.

- Upon using this service, a $15 charge will be added to your next Mesa utility bill.

- If your load exceeds 2,000 pounds, you will be charged for the entire load. Credit is not given for the first 2,000 pounds.

- Loads must be covered or securely tied down. Customers will be responsible for paying surcharges associated with uncovered loads

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Craigslist](https://phoenix.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

There is a large market of people in the Mesa area and across the country looking to save some money on a lightly used mattress rather than spending hundreds or thousands on a new one. If you mattress is in good condition and can be used by someone else you may want to consider selling it or giving it away on craigslist or Facebook marketplace. This is a great way for you to get the mattress off your hands and for someone else to get a great deal.

Be sure to take some nice clear photos and highlight any perks the mattress has. Also let potential buyers know that the mattress does not have any stains or bed bugs.

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![man-tearing-open-an-old-mattress](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-1024x572.webp)

Feel like taking on a small project and saving some money and the environment? Why not recycle your mattress yourself. We have a whole guide [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

First you will want to cut off the cover and separate the metal and foam inside.

The foam can be cut up and taken to a local carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. Be sure to call around first as not all carpet manufacturers will accept used foam from the public.

The metal inside can be dropped at any scrap metal yard where they will melt it down and recycle it. They may even give you some cash for it.
