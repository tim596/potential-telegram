## Option #2 [Request A Collection Of Bulky Waste](https://nola.gov/trash/)

![nola-gov-waste-disposal-logo](/images/blog/nolagov-logo-web.png)

By heading to the [nola.gov](https://nola.gov/trash/) website, you can find a selection of ways you can get rid of all kinds of waste, whether it’s yard waste like branches and leaves, solid waste, hazardous waste such as batteries and televisions, and bulky waste which includes mattresses. 

Residents will need to contact the number displayed in the “bulky waste” section of the website, and the mattress will then be picked up on the scheduled solid waste collection day which is usually on the 4th, 11th, 18th, and 25th of each month between 8 am and 1 pm. 

It should be noted that residents should not place their mattresses out for collection 24 hours prior to the scheduled pick-up time since this will result in a fine, so it is usually best to either place it out just before the agreed appointment time or keep it in the house until someone comes to take it off your hands. 

The drop-off point where your mattress will be disposed of is 2829 Elysian Fields, Avenue

New Orleans, LA 70122.

## Option #3: Donate The Mattress To [Habitat For Humanity](https://habitat-nola.org/give/donate/) New Orleans

IMPORTANT NOTE:

The Habitat for Humanity in New Orleans does not accept all mattresses. The mattresses they do accept must be less than 5 years old, have no stains or rips, no bed bugs and must be cleaned and bagged before dropping off. Please call Habitat for humanity before bringing your mattress to them to see if they will accept it.

If you would like to do your part and contribute to this incredibly reputable charity organization, you can simply take anything you would like to donate straight to their base on Elysian Fields Avenue which will then be sent directly to homeownership programs and services for those who are less fortunate. 

If you do want to contribute all you can to Habitat for Humanity and the families that it supports, there are also many other ways you can donate including financially or through the mail. Any donations, no matter how big or small, go an extremely long way.

### **Is It Unhealthy To Keep Around Old Mattresses?**

Even if you’re not using an old mattress anymore, simply keeping it around can still be considered unhealthy since there is a chance it can develop bed bugs, allergens, and dust mites which love nothing more than to infest old mattresses. 

### **What Is The Average Life Expectancy For A Mattress?**

While there is no magic number as to how long a mattress will last since it depends on how you treat them and their quality, they can easily last at least a decade as long as they are properly cared for.
