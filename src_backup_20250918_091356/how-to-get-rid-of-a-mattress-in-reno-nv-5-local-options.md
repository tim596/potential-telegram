## Option #2: Good Condition? Try To Donate Your Mattress

Donating your gently used mattress is a great way to keep it out of the landfill and let someone else get the remaining useful life out of it. There are many people who can’t afford a brand new mattress and  
would love to have something better to sleep on. The best way for you to donate is to contact your  
local charity, church, or community center and see if they are accepting them. Your mattress should not  
have any stains, rips, or bed bugs and should not be over 5 years old. Many donation centers do not  
accept king size mattresses.

We reached out to the donation centers in the Reno area and unfortunately, due to sanitary concerns and fears of bed bugs, the following centers are not accepting mattresses or box springs: [Goodwill](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/), [The Salvation Army](https://reno.salvationarmy.org/), [Habitat for Humanity](http://www.habitatforhumanityreno.org/), and [AMVETS](https://www.amvets.org/).

## Option #3: Drop Your Mattress at the [Lockwood Landfill](https://lockwoodlandfill.wm.com/index.jsp)

While this is not ideal, disposing of your mattress in a landfill is an option. Mattresses take up a lot of  
room in our nation’s landfills. They don’t compress or decompose and the materials can serve as useful  
items in other industries.

The Lockwood Landfill does accept mattresses. There was a free program, but it ended 2 years ago.  
There is now a fee of $37 per piece (subject to change). You will need a truck or vehicle to transport the mattress there. Call ahead for hours.

are a lot of people looking for good deals on lightly used mattresses. Be sure to include a nice picture of  
your mattress and put in the description - the age of the mattress, the size, and that it doesn’t have any rips, stains, or bed bugs. (You can find the manufacturing date of the mattress on the law label). Good  
luck and happy selling!

You can recycle your mattress or box spring yourself! It can be a fun family event and the kids can learn  
about the reuse of the materials. You can make things out of the materials – like foam dog beds. Or, if  
you live near some industry, you can take things like the foam to a carpet manufacturer. (Heads up –  
most carpet manufacturers don’t accept memory foam). Be prepared, it can get messy! You will need a  
tarp, a sharp knife or razor blade, some pliers, and enough space to lay the mattress down and work  
around it. There is a blog post that help explain how to do it yourself. Have fun!

We sure hope this information helps you to find an easy and eco-friendly way to get rid of your old mattress in Reno!
