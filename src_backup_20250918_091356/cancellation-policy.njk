            <h2>Our Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>At A Bedder World, we understand that plans can change. We've designed our cancellation policy to be as flexible and customer-friendly as possible.</p>

            <h3>Free Cancellation</h3>
            <p>You may cancel your mattress removal service appointment free of charge <strong>by 5pm the day before</strong> your scheduled pickup time.</p>

            <h3>How to Cancel</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Call us at <a href="tel:7202636094">(720) 263-6094</a></li>
                <li>Email us at support@abedderworld.com</li>
                <li>Use your booking confirmation link to manage your appointment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rescheduling</h3>
            <p>Need to change your pickup time? No problem! You can reschedule your appointment free of charge at any time before your scheduled pickup. We'll work with you to find a new time that fits your schedule.</p>

            <h3>Late Cancellations</h3>
            <p>Cancellations made after 5pm the day before your scheduled pickup may be subject to a service fee of $50. This helps us compensate our drivers who have already been dispatched to your location.</p>

            <h3>No-Show Policy</h3>
            <p>If our team arrives at your location and you're not available or haven't prepared the items for pickup as agreed, a $75 no-show fee may apply. This fee covers our team's time and transportation costs.</p>

            <h3>Weather-Related Cancellations</h3>
            <p>In cases of severe weather that makes service unsafe, we may need to reschedule your pickup. We'll contact you as soon as possible to arrange a new appointment at no additional charge.</p>

            <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
            <p>We strive to be as flexible as possible while maintaining reliable service for all our customers. If you have any questions about our cancellation policy or need to make changes to your appointment, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
