## Option #2: Donate To [Baltimore Furniture Bank](https://baltimorefurniturebank.org/)

![baltimore-furniture-bank-mattress-donation-homepage](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-9.28.26-AM-1024x416.png)

This company collects furniture and mattresses from the community and redistributes them to those in need. They are a non-profit organization.

You can drop-off or you can pay a pick up fee for them to pick up any items that you donate. They will then get redistributed to those who need them most.

_When it comes to mattresses, it is important that they are in very good condition, with no rips, smells or stains on them. They must be structurally sound and be less than 5 years old._  
_  
Any that are not in good condition will not be accepted. It is important to check this before you drop off or pay for the pick up as this can result in a lot of complications and wasted time and money._

This is a great service and option if your mattress is in good condition and still has a few years remaining in it. We always recommend donating first when it is an option.

## Option #3: Drop off at a [Baltimore Landfill or Transfer Station](https://publicworks.baltimorecity.gov/solid-waste/drop-off)

![baltimore-city-public-works-logo](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2023-03-03-at-9.35.45-AM-1024x168.png)

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress as a first option. If you are unable to do either of those and you have a truck or a means to transport your mattress then you can drop it at one of the local landfills or transfer stations for a fee.

We always recommend checking any updated regulations and fees on mattresses before dropping off, as many landfills are no longer accepting mattresses. As of the last updated revision of this post all of the locations below were accepting mattresses for drop-off/disposal.

If your mattress is still in decent condition and has some life left in it then you can almost certainly get rid of it by posting on craigslist or facebook marketplace. There is a large market for used mattresses in Baltimore and many people who would prefer a used one rather than spending hundreds or thousands on a new one.

Make sure you take clean nice photos and ensure any potential buyers in your post that the mattress is free from stains and doesn't have any bed bugs. This is a great way to get rid of a mattress for free or even make a little money, Happy Selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

Another option you have is to recycle your mattress yourself. This is a pretty straight forward process and can actually leave you with a little extra cash in your pocket.

To recycle your mattress you will first want to cut off the cover and separate the foam and metal inside the bed.

The metal can be dropped at your local scrap metal yard where they will weigh it out and pay you some cash for it.

The foam can be given away or sold to a local carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. Make sure to call first, as not all carpet manufacturers will accept used foam from the public.

## How Do You Know You Need A New Mattress?

Mattresses should be replaced around every 8 years. However, this statistic is just an average as some will last a lot longer than this and some will not last as long.

The best way to test whether or not you need a new mattress is by testing how it feels. If you feel that you are getting quality rest on your mattress, then it is likely not ready to be replaced.

However, if you feel achy and tired when you wake up, it is a good idea to replace the mattress.

## Is My Mattress In Good Enough Shape To Be Donated?

It is often the case that people wish to donate their mattress, but it is not seen to be in good enough condition to be donated. 

Every organization will have [different standards](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) for what they expect the condition of the mattress to be. 

These companies will look for things like bed bugs, [mold](https://www.abedderworld.com/mold-on-a-mattress.html/), stains, odors or other problems the mattress may have. You will not be able to donate any mattress that is not sanitary or that is not structurally sound.

## How To Clean Your Mattress 

There are lots of things you can do to clean your mattress before you attempt to donate it.

Vacuuming the mattress is one great way to do this. It can do wonders for removing pet hair and human skin. 

You should also ensure that you remove any stains as best you can. This can be done using carpet cleaner or stain remover.

Ensure that you wash the mattress down using a cleaning product. 

Whether your mattress is suitable for donation or not will depend largely on the way that it has been cleaned, so take your time with these steps.

## Final Thoughts 

There is nothing better than getting a soft new mattress to enjoy.

Having said that, there is nothing worse than having the old one lying around, waiting for the day that you sort out getting rid of it!

This article has given you lots of different great ways to get rid of your old mattress, from donation to recycling.
