If your mattress is still in good condition, somewhat new and has no rips, tear or stains you can likely find a donation center that will accept it for free. You can search the Honolulu reuse directory for a list of companies that accept different kinds of donations. Many of them accept furniture and may take your mattress as well. We always recommend reaching out before dropping off your mattress to make sure it meets their guidelines.

### REUSE Organizations

#### (Dispose of your Used Household Items)

These organizations accept used items such as: clothing, small appliances, bedding, small furnishings (end tables, chairs, lamps), toys, kitchen and household goods --except where noted differently. Contact the organization prior to dropping off your items.

## Option #3: Drop off at a [Local Landfill or Transfer Station](https://www.honolulu.gov/opala/quick-links/waste-drop-off-locations.html)

![city-of-honolulu-logo](/images/blog/logo_4.png)

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress before sending it to the landfill. Mattresses do not compress easily and take up a lot of unnecessary space. If you do decide to drop it at the landfill then the City of Honolulu has a variety of drop off locations and transfer stations that you can take it to.

The City and County of Honolulu provides nine public refuse drop-off locations: six convenience centers and three transfer stations around the island for residents to dispose of their household rubbish including but not limited to furniture, bulky items, large metal appliances, and green waste.

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Craigslist](https://honolulu.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in decent shape and is free from stains you can likely find someone to take it off your hands for free or even pay you for it. There is a big market for used mattresses on both craigslist and facebook that is worth a try.

You will want to take nice, clean photos and ensure potential buyers that the mattress does not have any stains or [bed bugs](https://www.abedderworld.com/bed-bugs-in-pillow.html/). Happy Selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

Feel like taking on a small project? You can always recycle your mattress yourself and save some money and the environment.

To do this you will first want to tear off the cover. Then separate the foam and metal inside.

The metal can be dropped at a [local scrap metal yard](https://www.islandrecycling.com/), where they will melt it down and recycle it (they may even pay you some money for it)

The foam can be taken to a local carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding.
