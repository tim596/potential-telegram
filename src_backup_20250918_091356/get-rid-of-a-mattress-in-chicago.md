# How to Get Rid of a Mattress in Chicago (5 Local Options)

Mattresses are large items that take up a lot of space in our nation’s landfills (26 sq. ft. per mattress on average!).  Mattresses also do not compress and the springs get caught in the machinery used in the dump, so landfills don’t want them.  Many landfills won’t accept them anymore.  Luckily there are other options in Chicago for you to dispose of your old mattress (such as recycling…That’s what we do!). We’ve made a list of options below for your reference:

## **Option #2:  Post it on [Chicago’s Craigslist Page](https://Chicago.craigslist.org) or on FaceBook Marketplace**

If your mattress is in decent condition, you may be able to sell it.  Mattresses are quite expensive and there are many people who do not have the resources to purchase a new one but would love a slightly used one.  When listing your mattress, make sure you take a nice picture and state that it DOES NOT have any stains and that it DOES NOT have bed bugs.  This will help to put potential buyers at ease.

## **Option #3:  [Donate Your Mattress](https://donationtown.org)**

Unfortunately, due to the sanitary concerns and an increasing prevalence of bed bugs, most nonprofits are no longer accepting mattresses at their donation centers.  The [Salvation Army was a great source for mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-salvation-army-take-mattresses.html/) for those in need, but they are no longer accepting them in the Chicago area.  Some churches still take mattresses, but they only accept them when they have a person in need of one, and they don’t usually offer a pickup service.  You can try a site called donationtown.org. They advertise that they pick up mattresses, but almost all of the charities that they work with are no longer accepting mattresses.  You may be able to find one in your area, but it is difficult and rare.  The best bet is to find someone you know – a family member or friend who could use your mattress.

## **Option #4:  Take it to a Landfill**

There are still landfills in the Chicago area that accept mattresses.  There is a fee for each mattress and there is usually an entrance or a gate fee as well. If you live inside the Chicago district, you can call 3-1-1 and request for them to pick it up for free.  The downside to this is that, well, your mattress will go into a landfill:

Republic Services – you can click on the link below and enter your address to find the closest landfill or transfer station.

## **Option #5:  [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.budgetdumpster.com/blog/how-to-break-down-mattress-and-box-spring/) Project**

Do what we do – recycle your mattress yourself!  All you need is an exacto knife and some space (things could get messy).  We have a great step-by-step guide on our blog post on [how to break down and recycle your own mattress](_wp_link_placeholder) or boxspring - Simply cut around the edges and rip the cover off.  Then, separate the foam from the metal springs.  You can take the metal to a scrap yard.  And, perhaps you can use the foam to make such things as a pillow or a dog bed.  Or take the foam to a carpet manufacturer – they can recycle the foam into carpeting underlayment.  Get the kids involved!  It’s a great way for them to learn about recycling and about being resourceful.  

There are quite a few [options in the Chicago area for getting rid of a mattress](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/progs/env/waste_and_recycling.html).  If you have any questions or need help disposing of your old mattress, please reach out to us or leave a message below.  We are always happy to try and help you to figure out how to get rid of your mattress in your area.  Just please don’t dump it on the side of the road or leave it in someone’s [dumpster](https://www.abedderworld.com/get-rid-of-a-mattress-by-throwing-it-in-the-dumpster.html/).  Then it becomes someone else’s problem and will most likely cost them time and money to deal with.
