If you live in St. Paul and are looking to get rid of an old mattress you may have noticed they are hard items to get rid of. Many landfills and donation centers no longer accept them due to their inability to compress as well as sanitary concerns.

Luckily, there are some mattress disposal services and options available to residents that still make it easy to dispose of that old mattress. From a statewide curbside mattress recycling service to a donation option and drop off locations, we have included something for every budget and every mattress condition.

## Option #2: Donate It To [Bridging](https://bridging.org/) or [St. Vincent De Paul](https://www.svdpmpls.org/)

If your mattress is in good shape and could be used by someone else then donating it is a great option. While many of the major donation centers do not accept mattresses anymore, there are a few local organizations that do. Bridging and St. Vincent de Paul Twin Cities both accept mattresses in good condition. Just make sure to contact them before donating to ensure they will take your specific mattress. You may also be able to set up a pick up if needed.

### Donation Location #1:

Bridging.org is a local organization. This organization accepts your household furniture that you no longer want if it is still usable. They will pass this on to those who need it the most. 

You can opt to drop-off your items at either of the locations. These are located in Roseville or Bloomington. When you drop off your items, you will not need to have an appointment. The stores are open from 9-6 Monday-Thursday and 9-3 Friday to Saturday. The company accesses used and new items that are free from stains, rips and strong smells.

You must clean any of these items before you donate them.

#### Rules for what kinds of mattresses are accepted:

![second-chance-mattress-recycling-drop-off](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2023-03-01-at-9.08.03-AM.png)

If you have a truck or a means to transport your mattress you can drop it at second chance recycling for a fee.

This company recycles over 60,000 mattresses every year helping to keep these mattresses out of landfills. This company is not only great because of the mattress recycling that it provides. It is also great because of the employment opportunities that it gives to the community.

It provides transitional employment opportunities for those who are returning from being incarcerated or those who have fallen into unemployment. Trainee jobs provide a very quick pathway to employment, allowing people to develop important employability skills and nurturing them in a supportive environment. 

This is a great opportunity as it not only encourages people to recycle and reuse their mattresses, it also focuses on employment for those who need it.

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Craigslist](https://minneapolis.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in decent shape you may want to consider [giving it away or selling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/) it online. There is a large market of people looking to get a lightly used mattress for a discount rather than spending hundreds to thousands on a new one. If you are willing to go the craigslist or facebook route you can almost certainly get rid of a mattress as long as it doesn't have any sanitary concerns or major issues.

For a successful sale be sure to take nice pictures and ensure potential buyers that it does not have any stains and is bed big free. Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

If you want to save some money and do the environment a favor you can opt to recycle your mattress yourself. This is a small project that includes the physical tearing apart of the mattress followed by the recycling of each material inside (metal and foam). We have a full article [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

To start you will want to tear off the cover and separate the metal and foam materials inside.

You can take the metal to a local scrap metal yard (like [us.emrlocal.com/yards/emr-saint-paul-scrap-metal](https://us.emrlocal.com/yards/emr-saint-paul-scrap-metal)) where they will likely even give you some cash for it. They will then melt it down and recycle it.

You can take the foam to a local business like a carpet manufacturer where they will use it to make carpet padding. Check craigslist for people looking for used foam and call around and you will be able to find someone who will take it off your hands.

Overall, there are a lot of great options for mattress disposal in the St. Paul area. The option you choose may depend on the condition of your mattress and your budget but we have tried to include something for everyone. We hope this article helped you find a great resource that works for your specific mattress disposal needs! You can also check the [City of St. Paul](https://www.southstpaul.org/492/Donate) website for any other options they may offer with your trash service.
