With growing environmental concerns and changing policies, getting rid of a mattress in Joliet, Illinois, isn't as straightforward as it once was.

Many landfills and donation centers have tightened their policies, no longer accepting mattresses or levying substantial fees to process them. This shift is largely due to the difficulty of mattress disposal and the environmental impact of non-degradable materials often found in mattresses. However, don't let these changes deter you; there are still practical and eco-friendly ways to dispose of your old mattress in Joliet.

In this article, we delve into 7 different options for mattress disposal in Joliet, ranging from recycling programs to thoughtful donations, and yes, even some landfill options.

If you don’t want your mattress to end up in a landfill but also don’t want to pay any fees, then you can try taking your mattress to your nearest recycling center yourself. 

Unfortunately, the current nearest mattress recycling center to Joliet, Illinois, is the [Green Spring Recycling Center](https://greenspringrecycling.com/).

Understandably, this is still a very long drive to do just for the sake of one mattress but if you are heading to Chicago anyway and you have room in your vehicle for your mattress, then why not take it along? 

You should first give the Green Spring Recycling center a call (call them at 262-412-1011)

Also, [ByeByeMattress](https://byebyemattress.com/find-a-facility/) has a great tool that helps you find your nearest mattress recycling center. If any new mattress recycling centers open up near Joliet, then the tool will help you find them - so check it out.

## Option #3: Donate Your Mattress

![local-mattress-donation](/images/blog/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

If selling isn’t your thing, but your mattress is still usable, you could try donating it. A donation can offer a person in need a comfortable place to sleep, and prevent the mattress from going to the landfill.

While some donation centers will accept mattresses, many of them refuse to take mattresses or box springs. This is largely due to the threat of bed bugs, and they will reject even good quality mattresses rather than take the risk. 

However, that doesn’t mean you can’t donate your old mattress. [Need Help Paying Bills](https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/will_county_clothing_closets.html) has a list of donation centers located in or around Joliet. Try contacting the places on the list, to see if they are willing to take your mattress.

If the mattress is in good condition, some places may even be willing to provide a pickup service. However, the majority of donation services will expect drop-offs.

## Option #4: [City Of Joliet Bulk Garbage Collection](http://joliet.gov/our-city/residents/garbage-recycling)

![](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2023-06-12-at-11.34.45-AM-1024x260.png)

It’s recommended that you try to donate or recycle your mattress whenever possible. However, if these options aren’t available, the City of Joliet offers a bulk item collection service.

This is collected with the weekly pickup, and the mattress must be kept dry. You can learn more about the City of Joliet solid waste collection service [here](https://www.joliet.gov/our-city/residents/garbage-recycling).

## Option #5: Drop Off At A [Landfill Near Joliet](https://www.joliet.gov/our-city/residents/garbage-recycling)

If you have no other options, you can always try taking your mattress to a landfill. This should be your last choice, as mattresses take up a huge amount of space in the nation's landfills. 

Some landfills no longer accept mattresses. This is because they are difficult to compress, and the springs can damage machinery. If you do intend to use a landfill, we recommend contacting them before dropoff, to see if mattresses are accepted.

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](/images/blog/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is still in good condition, but you need to replace it anyway, you might consider selling it or giving it away online. Although an old mattress might not make a huge profit, it’s a good way of getting it off your hands without having to pay.

The best way to sell a mattress online is through local community pages, such as Facebook Marketplace, and [Chicago Craigslist](https://chicago.craigslist.org/). These local services connect you to people in the area, which is preferable when you’re selling a bulky item such as a mattress. 

If you’re struggling to sell the mattress, you might consider offering it for free with pickup. You won’t be making any money, but it’s more likely to result in a quick sale.

Plus, you won’t have to try and find a vehicle that can transport a mattress from place to place.

## Option #7: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![inside-image-of-mattress](/images/blog/IMG_2004-1024x768.jpeg)

If you don’t mind getting hands on, you can recycle an old mattress at home! It does require some elbow grease, but it can potentially make you money, and prevents a mattress being added to a landfill.

You can find tips and instructions on how to take apart an old mattress [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/), and advice on recycling a box spring [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-box-spring/). Essentially, you have to break the mattress down into its component parts: the cover, the foam, and the springs.

Then, you can recycle or reuse smaller components, rather than struggling with a bulky mattress.

The fabric cover can’t be reused, but you may be able to take it to a fabric recycling center. Will County does offer an annual [textile collection service](https://www.willcountygreen.com/greenguide/textile_information.aspx), so you can try donating it here. Alternatively, you can make use of the old cover around the house.

The metal springs of your mattress can be taken to a scrap metal center in Joliet, such as [Berlinsky Scrap Corp](https://www.berlinskyscrap.com/). They will weigh the metal, and offer you a small payment.

As for the foam, try contacting a local carpet store, as the foam can be used to make carpet underlay. Alternatively, you can use it around the home to pad out pet beds etc.

## Final Thoughts

If you have a mattress to get rid of in Joliet, Illinois, there are several ways you can go about it. We recommend trying to donate or recycle your mattress, or using a service such as A Bedder World to do the job for you.
