If your mattress is in good condition you may want to consider donating it to someone who can use it. While the majority of donation centers throughout Fayetteville DO NOT accept mattresses, the Habitat restore thrift shop does accept them in GOOD CONDITION.

IMPORTANT: You mattress must be in nice condition and lightly used to be donated. This donation center\\ will NOT accept mattresses that are older, have stains or rips or are not structurally sound.

Before donating your mattress, it is important to check with the organization to make sure they still accept mattresses and need them at that time. In addition, only donate mattresses that are in good condition, as organizations will not accept mattresses that are stained or damaged.

## Option #3: Drop Your Mattress at [The Ann Street Landfill](https://www.cumberlandcountync.gov/departments/solid-waste-group/solid-waste-management/locations/ann-street-landfill)

![cumberland-county-logo](images/Screen-Shot-2023-03-29-at-8.45.00-PM-1024x274.png)

We always recommended recycling or donating mattresses before taking them to the landfill, as mattresses take up a lot of space and do not decompose easily. If neither of these options is available, you can drop your mattress at the Ann Street Landfill in Fayetteville.

### Terms of Payment

Cash, check or credit/debit cards are accepted. Charge accounts may be established through the Administration Office. Call 910-321-6929 for details.

### Fees

Pick-up trucks, cars, SUVs, and vans not pulling a trailer are charged a flat rate fee of $20 for chargeable debris per trip. This is not a daily rate.

- Household garbage (for residents paying the Solid Waste user fee) is no charge (up to 4 cubic yards \[one pick-up truck level load\] per week) unless mixed with chargeable items, then the load is charged the flat rate fee.

- Vehicles paying the flat rate fee will remain on concrete while at the landfill. These vehicles do not have to wait in line for weighing/reweighing, thereby, cutting down on time at the landfill and on damage to vehicles.

Apartments/condos/townhomes that do not pay the Solid Waste user fee annually are considered commercial and therefore pay for all debris brought to the landfill whether at the flat rate fee or by the ton.  
  
For a full listing of fees please view our **[**fee schedule**](https://www.cumberlandcountync.gov/docs/default-source/solid-waste-documents/fee-schedules/sw-fees-fy21.pdf?sfvrsn=da7c0c56_2)**.

### Covered Loads

All loads of debris must be covered with a secured tarp, cargo net, tie downs, or placed in a closed container so that no material can fall or blow out. Any vehicle without a covered load will not be turned away, but will be subject to the following fees in addition to current fees for landfill use:

- Cars, pick-ups or trailers: $10 per load

- Commercial and all other vehicles: $25 per load

The Ann Street Landfill has different areas for segregated solid waste disposal

If your mattress is in usable condition and you think someone could get some more life out of it you can list it on one of the local marketplaces and likely have it taken off your hands pretty quickly. A lot of people are looking to get a deal on a mattress rather than spend hundreds or thousands on a new one.

Just be sure to take nice pictures and emphasize the cleanliness of your mattress to put their mind at ease. Who knows they may even [pay you some cash for your mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/).

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

Recycling a mattress yourself and getting rid of the materials in Fayeteville, North Carolina, is not an easy task, but it is possible with the right tools and knowledge of where to take them. Here are some steps on how to recycle a mattress yourself and how to dispose of the foam and metal inside:

1. Disassemble the Mattress - The first step is to disassemble the mattress. Use a sharp utility knife or scissors to cut through the fabric and remove the outer layer of the mattress. Once you have removed the outer layer, you will be able to access the foam and metal springs inside.

3. Remove the Foam - To remove the foam, use the utility knife or scissors to cut the foam into small pieces. You can then put the foam pieces in a large garbage bag or container to transport. If the foam is in good condition, you can take it to a carpet manufacturer for recycling into carpet padding.

5. Remove the Metal Springs - To remove the metal springs, use pliers or a wire cutter to cut the springs into smaller pieces. You can then collect the metal pieces in a container for transporting to a recycler. Many scrap metal recycling centers in Fayetteville accept metal springs and will pay you for the metal.

7. Dispose of the Remaining Materials - After you have removed the foam and metal, you will be left with the fabric covering and any other materials that were used in the construction of the mattress. These materials can be disposed of in your regular garbage or used for DIY projects.

_It's important to note that recycling a mattress yourself can be a time-consuming and difficult process, especially if you don't have the right tools or experience. If you're unable or unwilling to recycle a mattress yourself, you may want to consider hiring a professional mattress recycling service or contacting a local recycling center to see if they accept mattresses for recycling._
