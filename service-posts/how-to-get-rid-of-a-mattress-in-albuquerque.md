## Option #3: City of Albuquerque Drop at [Landfill](https://www.cabq.gov/solidwaste/trash-collection/facilities) Or [Bulky Pick Up](https://www.cabq.gov/solidwaste/trash-collection/large-item-pick-up)

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress before sending it to the landfill. Mattresses do not compress well in the landfill and are becoming a major problem that cities and governments across the US are beginning to make laws against.

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If you're looking to get rid of or [sell a mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/), Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace can be great options. Here's how to do it:

1. Before posting your mattress on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, take some photos of it. Make sure to take clear, well-lit photos from multiple angles, including the top, bottom, and sides of the mattress.

3. Write a detailed description of your mattress, including the size, brand, and any other relevant information. Be honest about the condition of the mattress and any flaws it may have.

5. Decide on a price for your mattress. Look at similar mattresses for sale in your area to get an idea of what to charge. Be willing to negotiate with potential buyers.

7. Post your listing on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. Include the photos and description you created, along with your contact information. Make sure to specify whether you're willing to deliver the mattress or if the buyer will need to pick it up.

9. If a buyer decides to purchase your mattress, arrange for pickup or delivery. If you're delivering the mattress, make sure to take appropriate safety precautions and ask for payment in advance. If the buyer is picking up the mattress, make sure to give them clear instructions and be available to help load the mattress into their vehicle.

Selling or getting rid of a mattress can be a simple process if you use Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. Just be sure to take clear photos, write a detailed description, and be responsive to potential buyers.

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![man-tearing-open-an-old-mattress](images/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-1024x572.webp)

Recycling a mattress yourself may take some effort, but it's a great way to keep it out of a landfill and reduce your environmental impact. Here's how to recycle a mattress yourself:

1. Start by disassembling the mattress as much as possible. Use a utility knife to cut through the fabric and a pair of scissors or pliers to remove any staples or nails.

3. Separate the materials into different piles. Foam and metal can both be recycled.

5. If you plan to recycle the foam, you'll need to prepare it for recycling. Cut it into small pieces and bag it up. You can then take it to a carpet manufacturer or recycling center that accepts foam for carpet padding or insulation.

7. Take the metal springs to a scrap metal yard for recycling. Be sure to call ahead to find out what types of metal they accept and any preparation requirements.

9. The fabric from the mattress can be disposed of in your regular trash. If possible, you can also try to find a textile recycling center that accepts fabrics for recycling.

Recycling a mattress yourself may take some effort, but it's a great way to reduce your environmental impact and keep waste out of landfills. Make sure to follow any guidelines for mattress recycling in your area and dispose of any non-recyclable materials properly.
