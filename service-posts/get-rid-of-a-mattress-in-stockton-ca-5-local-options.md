Donating mattresses in Stockton at places like [Goodwill](http://www.goodwill-sjv.org/Donate) is actually much more difficult than people presume. Most donation centers do not accept mattresses and the ones that do have very strict regulations on which ones they will take.

Your mattress must be less than 5 years old, have no rips or tears and no signs of bed bugs. The mattresses also usually must be cleaned and bagged before dropping off. If you are considering donating we highly suggest calling the donation center before showing up as they will likely turn you away.

If you want to take mattress disposal into your own hands you can try recycling it yourself. You can tear the mattress apart and separate out the foam and springs. The springs can be brought to a local scrap metal center where they may even give you some cash for it. The foam can be dropped at a carpet manufacturer who can use it for the manufacturing of carpet underlay (call first to see who will take it).

## **How Do You Know You Need A New Mattress?**

On average, mattresses should be replaced every 8 years. Some mattresses will have a longer lifespan than this, and some will be shorter.

Those that have memory foam bases can often last a lot longer than this, even up to 15 years.

There are some ways that you can test whether or not you need a new mattress. The main test will be how it feels when you are sleeping on your mattress.

If you are able to get quality rest on your mattress and it feels comfortable and supportive, then it is likely not ready to be replaced. 

However, if you feel achy when you have slept on your mattress, it likely needs replacing.

## **Final Thoughts** 

Overall, getting rid of a mattress in Stockton is one of the easier places in the country, with a lot of eco-friendly and affordable options. Whether you want to drop if off or have it picked up there is an option for everyone.
