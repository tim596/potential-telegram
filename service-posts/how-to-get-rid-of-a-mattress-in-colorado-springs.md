If you live in Colorado Springs and have an old mattress you need to get rid of, you have come to the right place. In this article we cover 5 local options specifically for mattress disposal in the Springs area. From a curbside mattress recycling pickup service to donation centers, drop off locations and a DIY option. There is something for every person and mattress condition.

Mattresses have become harder and harder to get rid of over recent years due to increased regulations. Many landfills in Colorado will no longer accept mattresses due to their inability to compress and donation centers will not accept them due to [bed bug](https://www.abedderworld.com/bed-bugs-in-pillow.html/) concerns. Luckily Colorado Springs has had a lot of businesses pop up that cater directly to this mattress disposal problem!

If your mattress is still usable you will almost certainly be able to find someone to take it off your hands for free or who will even pay you for it. New mattresses are very expensive, so there is a large market in Colorado Springs for used mattresses.

Make sure to take nice clean photos of your mattress and list any positives and negatives that a potential buyer needs to know. Be sure to include that the mattress is stain free and bed bug free. Happy Selling!

_Always be smart and safe when selling things online. Be sure to meet in a public setting or have others around when the transaction takes place._

If you want to take matters into your own hands and take on a small project you can opt to recycle your mattress yourself. This will not only save you money but save the environment as well. We have a step by step guide on how to do this [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

You will want to cut off the cover and separate the foam and metal inside.

The metal can be brought to a scrap metal yard for recycling. They will weigh it and likely even give you a small amount of cash back.

The foam can be taken to a local carpet manufacturer in the area (call first as not all carpet manufacturers accept foam from the public). They will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. You can also reach out to any other businesses that may be able to use foam (we have found luck with companies making bean bag chairs, dog beds, pillows and many others over the years).
