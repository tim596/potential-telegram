Mattresses leave what they call "soft spots" in the landfill where they cannot compress trash into the earth, causing for wasted landfill space. Many landfills and [states across the country are banning mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/) and box springs or are charging large fees due to the inconvenience they cause and the space they take up.
