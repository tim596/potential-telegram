Although Montgomery doesn't have a mattress or large item pick up option of their own, the county does have many other resources and businesses that make getting rid of your mattress doable. Whether you need a drop off location or an eco-friendly recycling pick up option, we have made a list of our favorite 4 resources for residents to take advantage of.

## 2\. [Drop off at Mongomery's "Saturday Clean-Up Days](https://www.mc-ala.org/Living/Pages/GarbageCollection.aspx "Links active once published")

Once a month Montgomery County puts on a clean-up event where residents can bring trash and large items to drop off for free. See below for details:

_Note: This event only happens once a month and you must bring the mattress to one of their drop locations. You will be charged a fine if you are caught dropping at any of these locations without permission._![montgomery-mattress-clean-up-event](images/screen-shot-2018-06-24-at-5-47-05-pm.png) ![mattress-drop-locations-in-montgomery-al](images/screen-shot-2018-06-24-at-5-48-33-pm.png)

## 3\. Drop at a Montgomery Landfill

Although recycling your mattress is always our favorite option, sometimes it isn't always feasible or available. If you have a truck and a couple strong bodies you can take your mattress and/or [box spring](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-get-rid-of-a-box-spring.html/) over to one of Montgomery's landfills. It is always recommended to call before going to the landfill as prices and acceptable items can change on an almost weekly basis. A list of the major landfills in the area is below.

## 4. [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.budgetdumpster.com/blog/how-to-break-down-mattress-and-box-spring/ "Links active once published")

Montgomery doesn't have a mattress recycling program of their own, so if you want to dispose of your mattress with minimal impact on the environment you can recycle it yourself. [Budget Dumpster](https://www.budgetdumpster.com/blog/how-to-break-down-mattress-and-box-spring/ "Links active once published") has a great step-by-step blog ​post on how to break down and recycle your own mattress. To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for it.
