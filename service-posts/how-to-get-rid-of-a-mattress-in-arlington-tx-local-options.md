## Option #2: Donate it at Arlington's [Salvation Army](https://satruck.org/), [Arms of Hope](https://armsofhope.org/) or [Goodwill](https://goodwillnorthcentraltexas.org/)

![local-mattress-donation](images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

These are the 3 most common donation centers for people looking to donate mattresses or furniture. If your mattress is in good condition it may be worth trying to donate it and see if someone can still get some extra life out of it. There are lots of people who could benefit greatly form a used mattress rather than spending hundreds or thousands on a brand new one.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: Many donation centers are very strict about the mattresses they accept. They must meet strict guidelines such as:  
  
\- Be less than 5 years old with the manufacturer tag still attached  
\- No rips, tears or stains  
\- No bed bugs  
\- Must be bagged and sanitized before dropping off.  
  
Sometimes they simply do not need anymore mattresses. We highly recommend calling before dropping your mattress off.

## Option 3: Drop off At [Arlington Landfill](http://arlingtonlandfill.com/drop-off-information/disposal-costs/) 

![drop-mattress-at-arlington-landfill](images/Screen-Shot-2023-02-20-at-12.06.38-PM-1024x411.png)

We always recommend trying to recycle or donate your mattress first BUT if you can't do that and you have a truck or a way to transport your mattress then you can take it to Arlington Landfill.

However, due to the bulky nature of mattresses, the fact that the materials don’t compress, landfills are beginning to charge larger and larger fees for mattresses. Be sure to check rates and an updated list of the items they accept before heading there.

Rates vary depending on location, so you will need to call the Landfill at (817) 354-2305, or [check the website](https://arlingtonlandfill.com/drop-off-information/disposal-costs/) for more information.

Location:

Arlington Landfill

800 Mosier Valley Rd

Euless, TX 76040

_Note: You can also use one of your three free coupons a year as long as you are a resident. You will need to be the primary account holder on your Arlington water bill, and you should verify your account information before redeeming._

## Option 4: Sell It On [Craigslist](https://dallas.craigslist.org/) or Facebook Marketplace

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in good shape, then why not see if someone can use it. There are actually a lot of people who would prefer a used mattress for cheap rather than spending hundreds or thousands on a new one.

You may be able to sell it or give it away for free on online marketplaces such as Facebook or [Craigslist](https://dallas.craigslist.org/?postal=76013&search_distance=21).

Just ensure that your mattress is fairly clean, has no stains or bed bugs, and take some high quality photographs to list it with.

This will increase the chances of someone wanting to purchase it or take it off your hands.

## Option 5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![inside-lux-midnight-mattress](images/IMG_3264-768x1024.jpeg)

If you are looking to save some money and be environmentally friendly why not recycle your mattress yourself. It doesn't take long and could be a fun way to be resourceful.

To do this you simply tear your mattress open and separate the foam, cover and springs.

The cover will need to be tossed in the trash but the springs can be brought to your local scrap metal shop where they will give you some cash for it. The foam can be used by your local carpet manufacturer to make carpet padding.
