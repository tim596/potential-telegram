## Option #2: Donate Your Mattress

![local-mattress-donation](images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

IMPORTANT: Many donation centers are no longer accepting mattresses. The mattresses they do accept must be less than 5 years old, have no stains or rips, no bed bugs and be in great usable condition for someone else. They will likely want you to drop the mattress off cleaned and bagged.

### Here are a few donation centers in Amarillo to try for mattress donation...

1. [Goodwill Industries of Northwest Texas](https://goodwillnwtexas.org/) - They accept newer mattresses that are clean and in good condition. Contact them at (806) 331-9648 for more information.

3. [The Salvation Army](https://southernusa.salvationarmy.org/amarillo/) \- They accept gently used mattresses that are clean and free of stains or tears. Call them at (806) 373-6631 to schedule a pickup or drop-off.

5. [Catholic Charities of the Texas Panhandle](https://www.cctxp.org/) - They accept new and gently used mattresses. Contact them at (806) 376-4571 for more information.

## Option #3 - Sell Your Mattress on [Craigslist](https://amarillo.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

You might not think that anyone would want your used mattress. But the truth is that many bargain seekers will happily invest in a second-hand mattress. The reason for this is that brand-new mattresses [can be expensive](https://www.abedderworld.com/most-expensive-mattresses.html/), meaning that not everyone can afford them. To save cash, some people will be willing to invest in a used mattress. 

Therefore, one way of getting rid of your used mattress is by selling it on online platforms like [Facebook Marketplace](https://en-gb.facebook.com/login/?next=%2Fmarketplace%2F), [Craigslist](https://amarillo.craigslist.org/), or [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/). This is a much more suitable way of removing your old mattress than taking it to a landfill, as it allows this item to be reused.

Of course, your bed must be in a usable condition if you intend to sell it. This means no rips, stains or structural defects.

If you [sell your mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/) on any of these platforms, you should create a listing that has nice pictures and highlight the fact that the mattress is stain fee and doesn't have bed bugs.

Find a good price point that is not too expensive or even FREE and let someone take it off your hands for you. Happy selling!

## Option #4 - Drop at [The Amarillo City Landfill](https://www.amarillo.gov/departments/planning-and-development-services/public-works/solid-waste-collection-disposal/amarillo-landfill)

![amarillo-city-logo](images/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-7.58.26-AM.png)

We always recommend recycling or donating before taking your mattress to the landfill.

Some landfills will allow you to discard old mattresses, though you should bear in mind that your options will be limited to Amarillo.

The reason why so few landfills are willing to accept mattresses is that they take up considerable space. They also take a long time to decompose since many mattresses are made of both organic and synthetic materials.

We only advise taking your mattress to a landfill if none of the other options have worked out.

Yet, if you want to use a landfill service near Amarillo that accepts mattresses, this is your best option:

#### [**Amarillo City Landfill**](https://www.amarillo.gov/departments/planning-and-development-services/public-works/solid-waste-collection-disposal/amarillo-landfill) 

16250 Bezner Dr, Amarillo, TX 79124

This landfill service accepts a wide assortment of items, including old mattresses. They will take your mattress free of charge.

For other items, you will have to pay a landfill fee, which is often based on the weight of the object. Be sure to check out the website to see what items are exempt before you arrange a visit to the Amarillo  City Landfill.

## Option #5 - [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![inside-the-birch-mattress](images/IMG_4265-2-768x1024.jpeg)

If you don't mind getting your hands a little dirty, you can recycle your mattress yourself. This is a great way to be resourceful and eco-friendly.

To do this you will want to cut off the cover of your mattress and separate the foam and metal inside.

The metal can be brought to a local scrap metal yard where they will pay you some cash for the weight.

The foam can be dropped at a local carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. (Be sure to call first as not all carpet manufacturers accept foam from the public).

### Other DIY repurposing ideas...

- Pet beds

- Plant pot holders 

- A memory board

- Wine bottle storage 

So if you’re creative, why not give these projects a try?!
