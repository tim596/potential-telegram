## Option #2: [Bed Start - Donation Center](https://www.mysumc.org/bed-start)

![bed-start-mattress-donation-mckinney-tx](images/FamilyPromise.jpeg)

If you would prefer to donate your mattress to a good cause, you could always donate your mattress to Bed Start. Run by Stonebridge United Methodist Church, Bed Start is a community campaign that aims to help the less fortunate.

Supporting families in dire need of furniture, bedding, beds, and mattresses, this donation center is open throughout the year. The only unfortunate thing about this center is that it isn’t open all the time.

The center is usually open for collection once or twice a month. When the center is open, you can give them a call and someone will pick your mattress up. Alternatively, you can take it down to the center. 

Better still, if you want to get involved, you can join other locals in delivering your mattress and other items to the people that need them most.

If you go down the donation center route, you must make sure your mattress is up to standard first.

![inside-the-birch-mattress](images/IMG_4265-2-768x1024.jpeg)

Feeling resourceful? Why not recycle your mattress yourself. This is a great way to save some money and the planet. To do this you simply tear your mattress open and separate out the foam and metal inside.

The metal can be dropped at a local scrap metal center where they will weigh it and even give you a small amount of cash.

The foam can be brought to a carpet manufacturer (call first) where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding.
