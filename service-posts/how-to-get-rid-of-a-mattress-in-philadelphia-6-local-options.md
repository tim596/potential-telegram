## Option #2: Donate Your Mattress

![local-mattress-donation](images/Donate-Local-Red-243x300-1.png)

If your mattress is in decent condition you can reach out to some of the local donation centers ([Check out this article for Philly Donation centers and what they accept](https://www.inquirer.com/philly-tips/donate-furniture-clothes-philadelphia-pickups-20211018.html)). It is important to note that most donation centers do not accept mattresses and the ones that do are very picky about the mattresses they are able to accept (they must be in great condition). Here are some of the [regulations](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) they look for when accepting mattresses:

#### Mattresses for donation must meet this criteria:

- Less than 5 years old with manufacturers tag still attached

- No rips, stains or tears

- No dips or sagging

- NO BED BUGS

- Sanitized and bagged before dropping off

- Call first!

## Option #3: Drop at Any of The 6 [Sanitation Convenience Centers](https://www.phila.gov/services/trash-recycling-city-upkeep/find-a-sanitation-convenience-center-to-drop-off-trash-or-recycling/)

Although we always recommend recycling or donating your mattress when possible, if you need to bring it to the landfill you can drop it at a sanitation center in Philly. If you are a Philadelphia resident with a valid ID and you have a means for transporting your mattress you can drop it at one of the 6 trash centers around the city. You can only drop bulky waste items once per week and mattresses must be unwrapped to be accepted. Read more regulations below:

## Option #4: Sell it on [Craigslist](https://philadelphia.craigslist.org/) or Facebook Marketplace

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in decent shape without any rips or stains you will likely find someone who will take it off your hands for free or even pay you for it. There are lots of people who would rather buy a lightly used mattress than spend hundreds or thousands on a new one.

Make sure you post nice pictures and assure buyers that it doesn't have stains or bed bugs. Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

![inside-the-birch-mattress](images/IMG_4265-2-768x1024.jpeg)

Try your hand at a fun and eco friendly project and recycle your mattress yourself. Simply tear open your bed and separate the metal and foam inside. The metal can be dropped at a local scrap metal facility where they will weigh it and likely pay you a little cash. The foam can be brought to a local carpet manufacturer where they will shred it and use it to make carpet padding (call first to ensure they will accept your foam).

## Option #6: Lots of Junk? Try [‘We Love Junk’](https://welovejunkphilly.com/junk-removal-services/) 

![we-love-junk-philly](images/we-love-junk-logo-header.webp)

If you have a lot of junk items you can use a junk removal company to haul it away. We Love Junk was once rated the best local junk removal service in Philadelphia.

This service, which was started in Philadelphia and now has become a locally trusted name, can help you to dispose of all kinds of bulky items from your home.

Note a minimum charge for the We Love Junk service is quite expensive, and then every 3 cubic yards of junk added on adds an extra charge to the service.

Thus, you may not want to depend on the service if all you are getting rid of is a mattress.
