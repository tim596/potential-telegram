_Recycling is a great way to get rid of your mattress and help to keep your large, bulky item out of the landfill.  Luckily, L.A. has recycling centers that will tear your old mattress apart and use the materials to make such things as carpeting underlayment, sewer grates, wood pellets, and other useful things.  Some companies will also pick up your mattress from your home._

## Option #2: Drop off at a Local Landfill

Mattresses are a large item that take up a lot of space in our nation’s landfills.  Mattresses don’t compress, the metal coils get caught up in the wheels of the tractors, and most waste disposal centers are no longer accepting them.  But, there are still a few landfills in the city of Los Angeles that will take them (for a fee).  **_Call ahead to get pricing and to make sure they are still accepting mattresses:_**

## Option #3: City of Los Angeles [Bulky Item Collection](https://www.lacitysan.org/san/faces/home/portal/s-lsh-wwd/s-lsh-wwd-s/s-lsh-wwd-s-c/s-lsh-wwd-s-c-bic?_adf.ctrl-state=1q9hyctze_1&_afrLoop=19245340044672935&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D19245340044672935%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D1q9hyctze_5)

![bulky-item-collection](images/qa000765.jpeg)

The City of Los Angeles Sanitation and Environment suggests recycling your mattress or trying to donate it, but if that all fails, they will pick it up with their Bulky Item Collection program.  You can call them at the LASAN Customer Care Center number  1-800-773-2489 and schedule a pickup.

## Option #4: [Bye Bye Mattress](https://byebyemattress.com/los-angeles-mattress-pickup/)

![bye-bye-mattress-logo](images/BBM-Color-Paper-1@2x.png)

ByeBye Mattress is a directory with a list of mattress recycling centers throughout California that allow for you to drop off mattresses. You can enter your zip code and find the closest drop off location to your house. Some of these options are free, while others may come with a fee. We always recommend calling the drop off facility to make sure they are open and accepting mattresses before making the drive to their location.

## Option #5: Donate Your Mattress

Donating your mattress is a great way to get rid of your unwanted mattress and give someone else a chance to get the remaining useful life out of it.  Due to sanitary concerns, and fears of bed bugs, most donation centers are no longer accepting used mattresses.  But if your mattress is less than 5 years old, is free from satins and rips, and doesn’t have any bed bugs, some may be able to find a good home for it.

_**The following donation centers in L.A. are NOT currently accepting mattresses : [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitatla.org/), [The Salvation Army](https://losangelescentral.salvationarmy.org/), [Goodwill Southern California](https://www.goodwillsocal.org/), [St. Vincent de Paul of Los Angeles](https://stvincentla.net/), Los Angeles Mission, L.A. Road Thrift Store, pickupplease.org.**_

As an alternative, if you know someone who needs a mattress, or are part of an organization with an outreach committee, you may have better luck in placing your mattress.

It is important to note that custom size mattresses like olympic queen, 3/4 antique beds or others will not be accepted for donation, however _[rv replacement](https://www.abedderworld.com/rv-replacement-mattress.html/)_ size mattresses often will due to their high demand.

## Option #6: Sell it ([Los Angeles Craigslist Page](https://losangeles.craigslist.org/) or Facebook Marketplace)

![craigslist-logo-mattress-disposal](images/635925127643002128-a-copy-1024x579.jpg)

If your mattress is gently used, is free of rips or stains and doesn’t have bed bugs, you might be able to sell it or give it away on Los Angeles [Craigslist Page](https://losangeles.craigslist.org/) or FaceBook Marketplace.  New mattresses are quite expensive these days and there are many people who would love to get a deal and a good nights sleep on a decent mattress.  Hint:  When you list your mattress, be sure to take a nice picture (one that is in the bedroom and not standing up against a wall in a garage), and be sure to note that it doesn’t have stains, rips, or bed bugs.  Good Luck!

_SELLING TIPS: Be sure to take nice pictures. Let customers know how old your mattress is and that the mattress is bed bug free, stain free, etc..._

## Option #7: DIY - [Do it Yourself Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

If you have some space, and a few simple tools, you can tear apart your mattress yourself.  The basic components are fabric, foam, steel and wood.  If you live in a large city you might find a carpet factory or a carpeting warehouse who will take the foam.  They remanufacture it and use it in carpeting underlayment.  Wood pellet manufacturers for wood stoves will often take the boxspring wood.  If you live near a textile industry, they will take the fabric and use it for horse blankets or insulation.  There are many places that will take the steel.  Our blog post has a step by step guide to help you with the process.

We hope this list of options helps you to find a way to get rid of your old mattress. Good luck and if you have any questions, we are always happy to offer advice on any of the suggestions above.
