In order to get a mattress and/or boxspring picked up in Seattle you need to call SPU Customer Service at (206) 684-3000 to request bulky item collection. The $30 per item charge will go directly on your monthly utility bill. Once your pickup is scheduled, put the mattress in a place that is easily accessible from the street by 7am the next day.

## 3. [Drop Off at Seattle Dump/Transfer Station](https://www.seattle.gov/util/MyServices/Garbage/DumpTransferStation/index.htm "Links active once published") 

  
In Seattle there are two landfill locations to drop mattresses/boxsprings:  
\- [North](https://www.seattle.gov/util/MyServices/Garbage/DumpTransferStation/NorthStation/index.htm "Links active once published") - 1350 North 34th Street, Seattle 98103  
\- [South](https://www.seattle.gov/util/MyServices/Garbage/DumpTransferStation/SouthStation/index.htm "Links active once published") - 130 South Kenyon Street, Seattle 98108  
The transfer stations are open 8am-5:30pm Monday-Sunday.This disposal option works well if you have a [truck or another large vehicle to transport your unwanted mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/semi-truck-mattress.html/) and/or boxsprings. The downside being that mattresses dropped off at either of the above locations are obviously put into the Seattle landfill system. If possible, recycling your mattress is always a better and more environmentally friendly option than dumping at a landfill, as mattresses are tough to break down and take up a great deal of space.

## 4. [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.budgetdumpster.com/blog/how-to-break-down-mattress-and-box-spring/ "Links active once published")

Feeling ambitious? With only a few mattress disposal options available, DIY mattress recycling might be the right option for you. Aside from getting a great workout, you will feel good about your impact on environment preservation and conservation. Budget Dumpster has a great step-by-step blog ​post on how to break down and recycle your own mattress. To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for the foam.
