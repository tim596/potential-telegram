If you bought a mattress online, you may be wondering what to do with the old one!  Most landfills don’t want them because they are a large item that do not compress and they take up valuable space (an average of 26 sq. feet).  Luckily, if you are trying to get rid of a mattress or box spring in the Vancouver area we have put together a list of local options for you. These options range from companies that will pick up mattresses from your home (i.e. WE DO THIS!), along with drop off locations and [donation](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) centers.

## Option #2:  Search the [City of Vancouver Recycling and Reuse Directory](https://Cityofvancouver.us/publicworks/page/recycling-right-made-easy) 

Vancouver has a great recycle/reuse directory.  Although you may not initially think of it as an option for your mattress, there are actually many residents who would be grateful to have a mattress that doesn't cost them thousands of dollars. The city of Vancouver offers a reuse directory to help connect consumers with recycling and donation centers so that they can keep items out of the landfill and utilize them throughout their full lifespan potential. If your mattress is in decent condition, is no more than seven years old, and is not a [king size](https://www.abedderworld.com/king-size-memory-foam-mattress.html/), you can use the reuse directory to donate or sell your mattress to someone who may be able to use it.

## Option #3:  Post it on [Vancouver’s Craigslist Page](https://Portland.craigslist.org) or on FaceBook Marketplace 

If your mattress is in decent condition, it is very probable that someone may want to use it. Believe it or not there are actually a lot of people who benefit greatly from saving a buck and purchasing a used mattress.  PRO TIP:  make sure to take nice pictures and highlight the fact that your mattress DOES NOT have any stains and DOES NOT have bed bugs.   This will put potential buyer’s minds at ease and increase the chances that someone will take it off your hands for you.

## Option #4:  Drop Off:  [Columbia Resource Center](https://www.columbiaresourcecompany.com/)

**[West Vancouver Material Recovery](https://www.columbiaresourcecompany.com/west-vancouver-material-recovery)**

6601 NW Old Lower River Rd.

Vancouver, WA 98660

**[Central Transfer Station](https://www.columbiaresourcecompany.com/central-transfer-and-recycling)**

11034 NE 117th Ave.

Vancouver has 3 local landfill/transfer stations that allow for mattress drop off by the public.  If you have a truck, and a strong back, you can take it to the dump.  There is a fee, so call ahead for hours and pricing.  Many dumps have minimums, so it may be a good idea to coordinate with neighbors and friends in order to maximize your load.  The downside to this option is that the mattresses obviously go into Vancouver’s landfill.  Recycling is always a better and more environmentally friendly option.

## Option #5:  [DIY Mattress Recycling Project](https://www.budgetdumpster.com/blog/how-to-break-down-mattress-and-box-spring/)

Do what we do – recycle your mattress yourself!  All you need is an exacto knife and some space (things could get messy).  We have a great step-by-step guide on our blog post on how to break down and recycle your own mattress or boxspring - Simply cut around the edges and rip the cover off.  Then, separate the foam from the metal springs.  You can take the metal to a scrap yard.  And, perhaps you can use the foam to make such things as a pillow or a dog bed.  Get the kids involved!  It’s a great way for them to learn about recycling and about being resourceful.  

There are quite a few options in the Vancouver area for getting rid of a mattress.  If you have any questions or need help disposing of your old mattress, please reach out to us or leave a message below.  We are always happy to try and help you to figure out how to get rid of your mattress in your area.  Just please don’t dump it on the side of the road or [leave it in someone’s dumpster](https://www.abedderworld.com/get-rid-of-a-mattress-by-throwing-it-in-the-dumpster.html/).  Then it becomes someone else’s problem and will most likely cost them time and money to deal with.
