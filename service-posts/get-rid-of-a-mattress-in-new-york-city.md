In an effort to curb bed bug infestations and for sanitary purposes, the DSNY enforces rather strict rules regarding the disposal of mattresses.

So, how do you get rid of your old mattress?

Well, not to worry, as there are plenty of options when it comes to mattress disposal in New York City, and to ease your troubled mind, we’ve gone ahead and compiled the best ones in this post.

_Old mattresses are becoming more and more of a problem as they build up in landfills across the nation._  
  
_While some still accept them, many have taken on a strict no-mattress policy, as they hog a lot of space, and being that they don’t break down, they occupy said space permanently._  
  
_In light of this, mattress disposal is getting trickier by the year, but, thankfully, the following disposal methods are open to you in New York City._

## 6 Ways To Get Rid of a Mattress in New York City

* * *

## Option 1: [A Bedder World Mattress Recycling (New York)](https://www.abedderworld.com/mattress-disposal-new-york-city/) \- Curbside Pick Up Service

![new-york-city-mattress-recycling-service](images/Screen-Shot-2023-02-18-at-8.39.40-AM-1024x491.png)

You can easily book and pay for a pick up online with A Bedder World. They generally do outdoor/curbside pick ups but are great at working with people living in the city who need mattresses removed from an apartment complex (just put your needs in the notes section at checkout)

As it stands, Bedder World has recycled over 1 million old mattresses and box springs, meaning over 26 million square feet of US landfill space has been saved, not to mention helped a lot of people in need with their donation partners.

You can book a pick up online [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/book-online/). Pricing starts at $95 (around 30–40% cheaper than major junk companies), which includes pickup _and_ disposal!

If you’re unable to place your old mattress curbside, leave it anywhere where the drivers can get access and they’ll make it disappear.

- Serving the Entire NYC area and now serving the entire state of New York (Including [Brooklyn](https://www.abedderworld.com/Brooklyn-NY), [Yonkers](https://www.abedderworld.com/Yonkers-NY), [Manhattan](https://www.abedderworld.com/Manhattan-NY), [Queens](https://www.abedderworld.com/Queens-NY), [Newark](https://www.abedderworld.com/Newark-NJ), [Staten Island](https://www.abedderworld.com/Staten-Island-NY) all the way to [Buffalo](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-get-rid-of-a-mattress-in-buffalo-ny.html/), [Rochester](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-get-rid-of-a-mattress-in-rochester.html/) and everywhere-between.

## Option 2: [Salvation Army Donation](https://easternusa.salvationarmy.org/greater-new-york/)

![salvation-army-new-york-city](images/Screen-Shot-2023-02-18-at-8.52.50-AM-1024x149.png)

A lot of charities will turn down mattress donations, especially inter-state or nationwide organizations, as [differing local laws](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/) make these items tricky to process. 

That said, The Salvation Army is one of the few charities still accepting old mattresses in New York, but, as you might expect, they’re asking for a certain level of quality. Any stained, unhygienic, torn, or otherwise broken mattresses won’t be accepted. The mattress must also be less than 5 years old and still have the [manufacturer tag](https://www.abedderworld.com/mattress-tags.html/) intact.

The Salvation Army of Greater New York works with a plethora of local drop-off donation zones dotted all around the city, so there’s bound to be one near you, but you can also book a collection [here](https://satruck.org/donate/choose).

Bear in mind, however, that they may suspend their collection service in certain areas from time to time, so be prepared to transport your old mattress yourself.

- Lots of drop-off zones around NYC

- Puts your old mattress to good use

- Collection available (sometimes)

## Option 3: [Renewable Recycling Inc.](https://renewablerecycling.com/mattress-drop-off-recycling-long-island-new-york/) (Drop off)

![mattress-recycling-drop-off-nyc-logo](images/rri-logo-alt@2x.png)

Renewable Recycling inc. was started when husband and wife owners saw a surplus of discarded mattresses building up in their local NYC park.

Their eco-venture has scaled to the point they're able to work directly with business and government agencies, but they haven’t forgotten about the individual.

They have a facility at 3001 New St, Oceanside, NY 11572, where they accept drop-offs, but you’ll have to book an appointment, and it costs a minimum of $40.

Once you get there, they’ll unload your mattress for you and send you on your way — Try not to miss your appointment, as this company does not offer refunds.

If you live too far from their facility, you can schedule a collection appointment, but this costs considerably more than a drop-off.

Note — _Rescheduling of drop-off or pick-up appointments must be done 24 hours in advance of the initial appointment._

- Eco-friendly

- Collections for a fee

- Disposal of up to 20 items

## Option 4: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

If you want to take personal responsibility for the environmental disposal of your mattress, why not break it down into its raw parts yourself and then recycle them individually?

![How To Get Rid Of A Mattress In New York City (2)](images/How-To-Get-Rid-Of-A-Mattress-In-New-York-City-2.jpg)

Simply tear open your mattress and separate the materials. You can take the foam to a carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. You can then take the metal to a scrap metal yard where they will pay you some money for it.

Of course, the drawback here is that you have to spend time and effort breaking your mattress down and ferrying bits and pieces here, there.

* * *

## Option 5: Sell it or Give It Away ([Craigslist](https://newyork.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

Online marketplaces with a local focus such as Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace are a great way to get rid of your old stuff and make a few bucks in the process.

And if you don't get any takers, you can always list your mattress for free provided someone picks it up — Think of it as a community donation!

When listing, try your best to take nice, clear photos of the mattress in good lighting conditions.

Highlight the absence of stains and tears, and reassure potential takers that it’s 100% clean and bed bug-free.

- Free

- Potential money-making opportunities

- Community-forward

## Option 6: [Curbside Pickup By Local Authorities](http://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01969)

![nyc-311-logo](images/ico-311-51x51-1.png)

IMPORTANT NOTE: This service puts your mattress in the landfill and will not try to recycle or donate it.

We always recommend trying to donate or recycle your mattress before sending it to the landfill. But If you’re looking to keep things simple and cheap, you can always just leave your old mattress curbside for pickup by the city, but before you do, be sure to pick up a mattress sanitation bag from your local home improvement store. 

Un-bagged items will not be collected, and you can be fined $100 for potentially spreading bed bugs around the city.

The bags used can be any color but NOT orange or red.

While it’s fine to leave your mattress on the curbside, be sure it’s not blocking any public spaces, highways, or verges, and the city suggests placing it out-front between 4 PM and midnight the day before collection to ensure it doesn't take on any weather damage or occupy space unnecessarily.

If you’re low on funds, this is a good option, but bear in mind that the city isn't going to take the time to try to recycle any mattresses.

For more information regarding bulky item pickup in NYC, consult the official city website [here](https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01969).

- City-wide service

- Curbside collection
