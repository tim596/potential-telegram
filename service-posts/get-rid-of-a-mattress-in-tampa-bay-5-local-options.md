## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How Are Mattresses Harmful To The Environment?**

Each and every year, approximately 7.5 million mattresses are sent straight to landfills which then take up more than 1 billion feet of space.

Not only that, but mattresses actually contain toxic chemicals which are dispersed when they are crushed and destroyed, contributing to ground pollution and destroying ecosystems in the process. 

While not all mattresses are 100% recyclable, the majority of them are at least 80% recyclable which is why it is always much better and more worthwhile to send them to a disposal service that will recycle them responsibly.
