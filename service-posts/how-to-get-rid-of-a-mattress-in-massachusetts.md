![massachusetts-mattress-disposal-options](images/Most-Attractive-Youtube-Thumbnail-2023-03-12T194338.623-1024x576.png)

Back in November 2022, the Department of Environmental Protection in Massachusetts (MassDEP) added mattresses to the list of banned materials from disposal. The list also includes box springs and bed frames. There are special conditions for mattresses that are contaminated with bodily fluids, mold, and hazardous substances.

In this article we will look at 5 statewide options that residents can use for legal mattress disposal in Massachusetts.

If you are looking to get rid of an old mattress in the State of Massachusetts you will have more regulations in place than many other states. Mattresses do not compress down in landfills and take up a lot of unnecessary space. The state of Massachusetts, along with a few other states across the country has banned mattresses from being disposed of in the landfills. This means they need to be properly recycled.

Luckily, there are quite a few statewide programs and services available to get rid of your mattress properly throughout Massachusetts. From curbside mattress recycling pick ups to a directory of drop off locations, there is something for everyone.

If your mattress is in decent condition and could be used by someone else then you may want to consider selling or giving it away on craigslist or Facebook marketplace. There is a large market of people looking for lightly used mattresses rather than buying a new one for hundreds or thousands of dollars.

You may be surprised how quickly someone will take it off your hands.

Just be sure to take clean, nice photos and ensure potential buyers that it is free from stains and bed bugs. Remember to always be safe when meeting anybody online. Have others around when the meeting takes place or meet at a public location. Happy Selling!

Why not take matters into your own hands and save some money and the environment. You can always recycle your mattress yourself. There is a full post on how to do this [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/) as well as one on how to recycle a box spring [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-box-spring/).

To do this you will take the cover off and then separate the metal and foam inside.

The metal can be dropped at a local scrap metal yard (you can find one [here](https://iscrapapp.com/yards-in/massachusetts/)) where they will weigh it and even pay you a little cash. It will then get melted down and recycled.

The foam can be dropped at a local carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding. Be sure to call first as not all carpet manufacturers will accept foam from the public.

## Final Thoughts

Mattresses can last beyond a decade but when it comes time to replace them you should set some time aside to consider your options.

You could grab the toolbox and set about disassembling it, sorting through the parts, and recycling each component.

Alternatively, you could use a local service in Massachusetts that falls under the [Mattress Recycling Services Contract.](https://www.mass.gov/guides/mattress-recycling)

For a convenient means of recycling your mattress, and one that works for the common good, try A Bedder World which can pick up your mattress and deal with it responsibly. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **How Do You Cut Up A Mattress To Prepare It For Disposal?**

To cut up a mattress for disposal, start by cutting the cord from the edges with a utility knife for the piping thread.

Cut off the side panels next and then remove the top and bottom layers to sort out the fabric and internal layers.

Use some caution to cut out the metal springs as they can be quite sharp. You will also need to slice up the springs into more convenient, smaller parts to be reused. 

### How Long Does It Take For Mattresses To Decompose?

You should seriously consider recycling your mattress as they typically take decades to decompose. If you are looking for a rough figure, a mattress can take between 80 to 120 years to fully decompose.

Thankfully, a mattress that is kept in good condition should last for around a decade but sometimes longer.
