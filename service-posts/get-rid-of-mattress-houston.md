## Option #3: Post it for Sale/Free on the [Houston Craigslist](https://houston.craigslist.org/) Page

Believe it or not craigslist is actually a great way to get rid of a mattress for free and to have it actually be utilized to its full potential. There are a lot of people who don't want to spend the hundreds or thousands of dollars on a new mattress and who are very grateful to be able to get a decent mattress for a great price off of craigslist. If you are going to post your mattress on craigslist make sure that it doesn't have any stains. Stains are generally a deal breaker for most potential buyers. 

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-768x628.png)

**PRO TIPS**: Make sure to take nice pictures and highlight the fact that your mattress DOES NOT have any stains and DOES NOT have bed bugs. This will put potential buyers minds at ease and increase the chances that someone will take it off your hands for you.

## Option #4: DIY Mattress Recycling Project

![](images/Screen-Shot-2019-04-08-at-1.56.55-PM-768x429.png)

If you are a DIY and like taking on projects why not recycle your mattress yourself. This could be a great way to teach your kids about being resourceful or just a fun way to save some money and the environment. By recycling your mattress you can save on average 26sq.ft. of landfill space. We have a great step-by-step blog post on [how to break down and recycle your own mattress.](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/) Along with another post on [how to recycle your box spring yourself](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-box-spring/). To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for the foam.
