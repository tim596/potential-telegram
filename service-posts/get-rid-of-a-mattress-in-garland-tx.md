IMPORTANT NOTE: Bed Start will only accept high-quality mattresses. These mattresses should be less than 5 years old and have no stains or rips. If they are in poor condition, Bed Start will likely reject them. As a result, Bed Start is a great option for getting rid of gently used mattresses.

This ministry is dedicated to providing bedding and furnishing to the people who need it most. As a result, this is an excellent cause that you can donate your mattress if you live in Garland.

Bed Start will accept beds in a range of sizes, including a king, twin, queen and bunk.

## Option #3 - Drop at [C.M. Hinton Jr. Regional Landfill](https://www.garlandtx.gov/3673/Hinton-Landfill)

Ideally, you should only turn to local landfills if you have no other options available for removing your mattress.

Mattresses not only take up loads of space in landfills, but they can also prove to be quite problematic as they do not break down properly. As a consequence, fewer and fewer landfills are willing to accept mattresses. 

However, if no other option works for you, here is a landfill in Garland that may be willing to take your old mattress:

#### C.M. Hinton Jr. Regional Landfill And Wood Recycling Facility

3175 Elm Grove Rd, Rowlett, TX 75089

If you don’t mind dropping off the mattress, C.M. Hilton Jr. is perhaps the best landfill for you. This landfill accepts a broad spectrum of items, including mattresses. They also take demolition and construction waste, making this an incredibly versatile landfill option. 

The bad news is that this is the only landfill business in Garland that openly accepts mattresses. So if you live far away from this area, you may need to look at an alternative method of discarding the mattress.

## Option #4 - Sell It on [Garland Craigslist](https://dallas.craigslist.org/?postal=75040&search_distance=13) or Facebook Marketplace

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

You might be surprised to learn that there is a large industry for [selling used mattresses](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-sell-used-mattresses.html/). The reason for this is that mattresses can be an expensive investment. As a result, many people are willing to reduce costs by purchasing second-hand mattresses.

These second-hand mattresses can fetch you approximately $100, though this will depend on factors such as their size and quality.

Two of the best sites for selling your used mattresses are Craigslist [](https://austin.craigslist.org/)and [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=%2Fmarketplace%2F). Used by millions of people, these sites allow you to make a profit from your unwanted items. You can easily find buyers in your local area who will be willing to take an old mattress off your hands for free or pay you.

Remember to take high-quality photos of the mattress and highlight the quality of the mattress by noting that it doesn’t contain any rips, stains or bed bugs.

The benefit of selling or giving away your mattress through these sites is that you can save or make some money. Not to mention, the mattress will be reused, making it a more environmentally-friendly option.

![inside-lux-midnight-mattress](images/IMG_3264-768x1024.jpeg)

If you are feeling like taking matters into your own hands, It isn't too difficult to recycle your mattress yourself.

Simply cut off the cover and separate the foam and metal inside. (we have a full article on how to do it [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/))

The metal can be taken to a local scrap metal yard where they will likely even pay you a little cash for it.

The foam can be taken to a local carpet manufacturer where they will shred it up and use it to make carpet padding (call first to ensure they will accept used foam, not all do).
