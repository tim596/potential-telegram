If possible, avoid giving out your personal information, such as your address or phone number.

5. Remove the Metal Springs - In needed you can use pliers or a wire cutter to cut the springs into smaller pieces. You can then bring the springs to a local scrap metal yard. Many scrap metal recycling centers accept metal springs and will pay you for the metal based on weight.

7. Dispose of the Remaining Materials After you have removed the foam and metal, you will be left with the fabric covering and any other materials that were used in the construction of the mattress. These materials can be disposed of in your regular garbage.
