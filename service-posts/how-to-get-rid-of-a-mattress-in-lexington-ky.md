If your mattress is in good shape and could be used by someone else you may want to consider donating it. While the major donation centers like goodwill and Habitat for Humanity no longer accept mattresses in Lexington, The Kentucky Refugee Minitries does.

The Kentucky Refugee Ministries helps to resettle refugees and and immigrants. They accept furniture donations including mattresses, box springs, bed frames and even bedding and pillows in good condition.

We always recommend recycling or donating your mattress before disposing of it in the landfill, as mattresses are hard to compress and break down and take up a lot of unnecessary space. But sometimes the landfill is your only option. If you have a means of transporting your mattress you can bring it to the Bluegrass transfer station which is a partnership between the city of Lexington and the Bluegrass waste service company.

**All rates are subject to the Kentucky Environmental Remediation fee of $1.75 per ton and applicable fuel surcharges, environmental and other fees and sales tax.** 

> - Gate rate of $106 per ton
> 
> - Minimum charge of $58

## Option #4: Sell or Giveaway on [Lexinton's Craigslist](https://lexington.craigslist.org/) or Facebook

![mattress-disposal-austin-craigslist](images/Screen-Shot-2019-12-11-at-8.06.07-AM-edited.png)

If your mattress is in decent shape you may want to consider giving it away or selling it online. There is a large market of people looking to get a lightly used mattress for a discount rather than spending hundreds to thousands on a new one. If you are willing to go the craigslist or facebook route you can almost certainly get rid of a mattress as long as it doesn't have any sanitary concerns or major issues.

For a successful sale be sure to take nice pictures and ensure potential buyers that it does not have any stains and is bed big free. Happy selling!

## Option #5: [DIY Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/)

If you want to save some money and do the environment a favor you can opt to recycle your mattress yourself. This is a small project that includes the physical tearing apart of the mattress followed by the recycling of each material inside (metal and foam). We have a full article [here](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/).

To start you will want to tear off the cover and separate the metal and foam materials inside.

You can take the metal to a local scrap metal yard (like https://www.cohenusa.com/lexington/) where they will likely even give you some cash for it. They will then melt it down and recycle it.

You can take the foam to a local business like a carpet manufacturer where they will use it to make carpet padding. Check craigslist for people looking for used foam and call around and you will be able to find someone who will take it off your hands.

We hope this article helped you to find a way to get rid of your mattress that works with your budget and your specific mattress condition. Lexington luckily has quite a few options available to residents than many other cities across the country do not have.
