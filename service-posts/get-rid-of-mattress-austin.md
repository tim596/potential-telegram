### _Current state of mattress disposal in Austin_

When you purchase a mattress it never really crosses your mind that someday you will have to find a way to dispose of it. With the rise of online mattress sales, it is becoming more and more of a problem for consumers to find ways to get rid of their old mattresses after purchasing a new one. Due to their size and inability to break down in the landfill, mattresses are some of the hardest items to dispose of. Luckily, if you are trying to get rid of a mattress or box spring in the Austin area we have put together a list of local options that you can utilize. These options range from companies that will pick mattresses up from your home (i.e. WE DO THIS!), along with drop off locations and donation centers.

## Option #1: [A Bedder World Mattress Recycling](https://www.abedderworld.com/mattress-disposal-austin/)\- Curbside & In Home Pick Up Services

## Option #2: Search the [City of Austin Reuse Directory](https://austineconetwork.com/austin-reuse-directory/)

Austin has put together a great program where residents can easily search donation centers and local companies that allow them to buy, sell, donate and rent used items. Although you may not initially think of this as an option for your mattress, there are actually many residents who would be grateful to have a mattress that doesn't cost them thousands of dollars. The city of Austin offers a [reuse directory](https://austineconetwork.com/austin-reuse-directory/) to help connect customers with recycling and donation centers so that they can keep items out of the landfill and utilize them throughout their full lifespan potential. If your mattress is in decent condition you can use the Reuse directory to donate or [sell](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/) your mattress to someone who may be able to use it.

If your mattress is in decent condition, it is very probable that someone may want to use it. Believe it or not there are actually a lot of people who benefit greatly from saving a buck and purchasing a used mattress. PRO TIP: Make sure to take nice pictures and highlight the fact that your mattress DOES NOT have any stains and DOES NOT have bed bugs. This will put potential buyers minds at ease and increase the chances that someone will take it off your hands for you.

## Option #4: Drop off: [Austin Community Landfill](https://www.wmsolutions.com/locations/details/id/109) or [Travis County Landfill](https://www.wasteconnections.com/travis-county-landfill)

### Austin Area Landills

[WASTE MANAGEMENT - AUSTIN COMMUNITY LANDFILL](https://www.wmsolutions.com/locations/details/id/109) 

9900 GILES ROAD

AUSTIN, TX 78754 

[TRAVIS COUNTY LANDFILL](https://www.wasteconnections.com/travis-county-landfill)9600 FM 812AUSTIN, TX 78719-9734

Austin has 2 local landfills that are open to the public for junk drop-off (including mattresses and box springs). Although it's not ideal, Austin doesn't have any mattress recycling facilities that are open to the public for drop off. If you have a truck and a couple strong volunteers you can load up your mattress set and take it to the dump. The landfills in Austin do accept mattresses for a fee.  Many dumps have minimums so if you can find other friends or neighbors who also need to get rid of a mattress you can save a bit by sharing the cost.  This disposal option works well if you have a truck or another large vehicle to transport your unwanted mattress and/or boxsprings. The downside being that mattresses dropped off at either of the below landfill locations are obviously put into the Austin landfill system. If possible, recycling your mattress is always a better and more environmentally friendly option than dumping at a landfill, as mattresses are tough to break down and take up a great deal of space.

## Option #5: DIY Mattress Recycling Project

If you are a DIY and like taking on projects why not recycle your mattress yourself. This could be a great way to teach your [kids](https://www.abedderworld.com/best-twin-mattress-for-kids.html/) about being resourceful or just a fun way to save some money and the environment. By recycling your mattress you can save on average 26sq.ft. of landfill space. We have a great step-by-step blog post on [how to break down and recycle your own mattress.](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-mattress/) Along with another post on [how to recycle your box spring yourself](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-recycle-a-box-spring/). To do this all you need is an exacto knife and some space (things may get messy). Simply [cut around the edges of the mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/how-to-cut-a-memory-foam-mattress.html/) until you can take off the cover. Inside you will find foam and metal springs. Separate the foam and metal. You can actually bring the metal springs to the scrap yard and they will pay you for them. As for the foam you can shred it up and use it in dog beds, to fill pillows, or you can find a local carpet manufacturer who may pay you for the foam.
