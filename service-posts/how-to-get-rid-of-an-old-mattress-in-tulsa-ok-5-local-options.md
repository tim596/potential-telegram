Giving your mattress to someone in need is a perfect way to get rid of your unwanted mattress. There  
are many people who would love to have a lightly used, comfortable mattress to sleep on. Before  
donating your mattress, make sure it is free of stains, rips, and bed bugs.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: We reached out to the donation centers in the Tulsa area and unfortunately, due to sanitary concerns and fears of bed bugs, the following centers are not accepting mattresses or box springs anymore: [The Tulsa Day Center](https://tulsadaycenter.org/), Family and Children’s Services, [Habitat for Humanity](https://greencountryhabitat.org/), [AMVETS](https://www.amvetspickup.org/pickups/), [Goodwill](https://www.abedderworld.com/does-goodwill-take-mattresses-4-alternative-options.html/), and [The Salvation Army](https://southernusa.salvationarmy.org/tulsa-area-command/)

You can recycle your mattress yourself! It can be a fun and educational learning experience for the  
whole family. You will need some space to work around the mattress, a tarp, a knife or razor blade, and  
some pliers. There is a blog post that help explain how to do it yourself. You can take the raw materials  
from your mattress to places like a carpet manufacturer – they will use the foam for carpet padding.  
Take the wood from your box spring to a pellet stove manufacturer. Have fun!

## Option #5: Drop it at the [Tulsa Indoor Dump](https://tulsaindoordump.com/)

![tulsa-indoor-landfill-map](images/Dump_Map_2500w-1024x499.jpeg)

As a last resort, you can landfill your mattress. If you have a truck and a strong back, you can load up  
your mattress and take it to a landfill. The Tulsa indoor dump charges $45 as a minimum dump fee plus  
$10 per mattress for a king, queen, or full size and an extra $7 for a twin or crib size. So, approximately  
$55 for one piece or $65 for a set.

Call ahead to make sure they are still accepting mattresses because  
many landfills are not taking them anymore.

Tulsa Indoor Dump  
M-F 7am to 4:30pm. Sat 8am til 1:30pm  
1150 N Peoria Ave, Tulsa, OK, 74106
