If your mattress is in good condition you may want to consider donating it to someone who can use it. While the majority of donation centers throughout Pasadena DO NOT accept mattresses, the Houston Furniture Bank does accept them in GOOD CONDITION.

IMPORTANT: You mattress must be in nice condition and lightly used to be donated. This donation center will NOT accept mattresses that are older, have stains or rips or are not structurally sound.

Before donating your mattress, it is important to check with the organization to make sure they still accept mattresses and need them at that time. In addition, only donate mattresses that are in good condition, as organizations will not accept mattresses that are stained or damaged.

Up next, is to use a local landfill service to discard the mattress. There are plenty of landfill services available in Pasadena, so you're bound to find something appropriate for you.

It’s worth bearing in mind that landfills are not the preferred method of getting rid of mattresses. The reason for this is that mattresses will take up a significant amount of space in the landfills and are hard to compress and breakdown.

Yet, there are plenty of landfill companies in the Pasadena area that will accept your mattresses, including:

#### [**Greenbelt Landfill**](https://wastebits.com/locator/location/greenbelt-landfill)

550 Old Genoa Red Bluff Rd, Houston, TX 77034

If your mattress is in usable condition and you think someone could get some more life out of it you can list it on one of the local marketplaces and likely have it taken off your hands pretty quickly. A lot of people are looking to get a deal on a mattress rather than spend hundreds or thousands on a new one.

Just be sure to take nice pictures and emphasize the cleanliness of your mattress to put their mind at ease. Who knows they may even [pay you some cash for your mattress](https://www.abedderworld.com/is-it-illegal-to-sell-a-used-mattress-state-by-state-guide.html/).

Recycling a mattress yourself and getting rid of the materials in Pasadena, is not an easy task, but it is possible with the right tools and knowledge of where to take them. Here are some steps on how to recycle a mattress yourself and how to dispose of the foam and metal inside:

1. Disassemble the Mattress - The first step is to disassemble the mattress. Use a sharp utility knife or scissors to cut through the fabric and remove the outer layer of the mattress. Once you have removed the outer layer, you will be able to access the foam and metal springs inside.

3. Remove the Foam - To remove the foam, use the utility knife or scissors to cut the foam into small pieces. You can then put the foam pieces in a large garbage bag or container to transport. If the foam is in good condition, you can take it to a carpet manufacturer for recycling into carpet padding.

5. Remove the Metal Springs - To remove the metal springs, use pliers or a wire cutter to cut the springs into smaller pieces. You can then collect the metal pieces in a container for transporting to a recycler. Many scrap metal recycling centers in Pasadena accept metal springs and will pay you for the metal.

7. Dispose of the Remaining Materials - After you have removed the foam and metal, you will be left with the fabric covering and any other materials that were used in the construction of the mattress. These materials can be disposed of in your regular garbage or used for DIY projects.

_It's important to note that recycling a mattress yourself can be a time-consuming and difficult process, especially if you don't have the right tools or experience. If you're unable or unwilling to recycle a mattress yourself, you may want to consider hiring a professional mattress recycling service or contacting a local recycling center to see if they accept mattresses for recycling._

We know that throwing your old mattresses away is often much easier said than done, and we know just how daunting the task can be.

So, we hope that this guide has proven helpful and that you now feel fully equipped to dispose of your old mattresses in a way that is efficient and great for the planet.
