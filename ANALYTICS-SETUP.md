window.BedderAnalytics.track('competitor_comparison_viewed', {
  competitor: 'Company X',
  location_city: 'denver',
  location_state: 'colorado'
});

// Track pricing experiments
window.BedderAnalytics.track('pricing_test_viewed', {
  test_version: 'A',
  price_shown: 125,
  location_city: 'houston'
});
```

### API Integration

Use the analytics API for custom integrations:

```javascript
// Get location-specific analytics
const locationData = await fetch('/api/location-analytics/colorado/denver')
  .then(response => response.json());

// Export custom date ranges
const csvData = await fetch('/api/analytics-export?type=events&days=60')
  .then(response => response.text());
```

### Automated Reporting
